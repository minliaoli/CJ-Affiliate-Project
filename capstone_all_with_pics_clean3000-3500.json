Your adventure begins near the entrance to Denali National Park where you meet your driver-guide and head deep into the Alaskan bush. Your destination is the Stampede Trail. Not shown on most maps, this forgotten road was carved out of the wilderness by the early miners of the Kantishna region, seeking gold and antimony. The Stampede Trail gained notoriety in 1996 from the best-selling novel \u0093Into The Wild\u0094 by Jon Krakauer, and subsequently, from the critically acclaimed motion picture directed by Sean Penn. This is the very same trail that Christopher McCandless, subject of the book and movie, took to enter the wilds of Alaska. The first few miles of the Stampede Road are paved, but beyond this point, your guide will take you along very primitive trail with plenty of bumps, mud, and off-road 4x4 adventure. Your guide will explain the area's rich history, point out interesting sights along the way, and allow ample time to view and explore the open tundra. Don't forget your camera! On a clear day, you may have the opportunity to see Denali (formerly Mt. McKinley) from a viewpoint along the trail. Also, be prepared for wildlife sightings--this is prime habitat for moose, caribou, bears, and foxes, as well as a multitude of smaller critters.

Because MOF stands for Ministry of Forests, 89% of these campgrounds are free of charge. </P><P>Camp Free in B.C. offers precise directions to the best 430 MOF campgrounds in southern and central British Columbia. A few are big, organized, groomed, much like provincial parks and nearly as popular. Others are tiny, rough hewn, seldom visited, almost certain to offer solitude. Many are hidden just a short distance off paved roads. Some are deep in the woods. All are accessible by two-wheel-drive. You can reach them easily and safely in your low-clearance car or big RV. En route, you'll savour a fresh perspective on the stunning geography of this glorious province. You'll be astonished at where B.C.'s seemingly endless network of backroads can take you. Even with our detailed directions, you'll feel the excitement of discovery. </P><P>Nearly all the campgrounds in this book are away from towns and highways, so you'll likely glimpse one of the locals: perhaps an owl or a coyote, maybe a bear or a moose. Even the common sight of a deer or a salmon can thrill and comfort, reminding you that despite the damage done, wilderness still exists and nature is alive and well. That's the joy of free-camping. Not just what you keep in your wallet, but what you take away in your heart. </P><P>Camping is CPR for your senses. It opens your eyes to the night sky, with stars so thick they look like clouds. It opens your ears to the music of wind in the trees, water rushing over rocks, or maybe absolute silence. It reacquaints you with the simple, sweet pleasure of not feeling cement under foot, not being confined by fences or walls, not complying with rules, and sometimes not having to look at another human being. It's the antidote to civilization. </P><P>And free camping is real camping. It's an adventure--something sadly missing from most people's lives and impossible to find at commercial campgrounds. Neon signs? Receptions offices? Pop machines? Hook-ups? TV antennas? Where's the adventure in that? It's hard to tell many campgrounds from RV dealerships these days. They're just parking lots. Even provincial-park campgrounds are often within earshot of a roaring highway. </P><P>You'll forgo conveniences at the campgrounds described in Camp Free. None have showers, flush toilets, or even running water. But what most people consider necessities are actually luxuries. Doing without can make you feel more complete. And camping, by definition, means contending with the elements--bugs, wind, rain, cold, heat. But if you're prepared and can shrug off minor discomfort, the elements can make you feel more alive. </P><P>If you go with an open mind and soft heart, Camp Free will guide you to a rousing experience. You'll be revitalized, able to calmly slip back into the shackles of civilization with renewed vigor. Your memory, your mental gallery, will be filled with vivid images--sustenance for the soul until your next outing.
