classes:

class Offer
def getPairs()
def getText()

class blog
def getPairs()
def getText()


the two functions are ideal in both classes.

getpairs() returns a key_score object which has _str_ method that returns sth like this:

[‘Score’:’0.99’, ‘keyword’: ‘clothing’,
‘Score’:’0.97’, ‘keyword’: ‘women’,
‘Score’:’0.90’, ‘keyword’: ‘Adidas’,
…
]

gettext() returns a string of text which is either offer description or blog text.

def get_tag(string text)
