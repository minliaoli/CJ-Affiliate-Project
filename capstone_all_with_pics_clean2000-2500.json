These problems lead to high information asymmetry within the agricultural lending process. Because information is incomplete agricultural lending is costly. Consequently many micro finance institutions (MFIs) have concentrated their branches and activities in urban areas. Therefore scepticism is growing about their role in mobilising rural savings and offering rural lending services. Financial cooperatives demanding compulsory savings and enforcing group lending schemes are able to reduce information asymmetry and hence transaction costs of agricultural lending. Since the financial cooperative follows a minimalist approach, it does not offer non-financial services such as storage facilities, training in farming techniques or the treatment of agricultural produce. In order to enhance clients' ability to utilize credit, and thereby to improve their repayment rates, an MFI should follow the integrated approach. The MFI with an integrated approach offers credit combined with non-financial services. The grain bank is seen as a financial institution which links products and services of the financial cooperative with those of the integrated approach. The grain bank replaces physical cash with grains and farm inputs. Six main products are offered by the grain bank: savings in grain, input credit, inventory credit, household food security loan, storage services and training services. Further the grain bank provides access to input and output markets otherwise not available for the farmer. The Ghanaian 'Centre for Agriculture and Rural Development' (CARD) is such a grain bank. The results show that CARD has a better financial sustainability than other Ghanaian MFIs not operating as a grain bank. Although the study reveals that the outreach of CARD is not as encouraging as assumed, the clients seem to be satisfied with the services received by CARD. At the same time the results of the econometric analysis indicate that the provision of credit supplied by CARD increases farmer's output with potential effects on income.", "title": "The grain banking model: The research case of the Centre for Agriculture and Rural Development (CARD) in Ghana Anna Wolff Author", "price": {}, "catalogId": "5879", "advertiserName": "Barnes & Noble", "imageLink": "https://prodimage.barnesandnoble.com/pimages/9783640585069_p0_v1_s192x300.jpg", "link": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-grain-banking-model-anna-wolff/1119532785?ean=9783640585069", "id": "9783640585069", "categoryName": "Business Technology Society"}, {"description": "Bank Regulation, Credit Information, and Bank Cross-border M&As", "title": "Bank Regulation, Credit Information, and Bank Cross-border M&As", "price": {}, "catalogId": "8605", "advertiserName": "Indigo Books & Music", "imageLink": "https://dynamic.indigoimages.ca//books/9781360996349.jpg?width=200&maxheight=200", "link": "https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/product/9781360996349-item.html", "id": "978136099634", "categoryName": "Society Business Home"}, {"description": "Finance is a matter that surrounds everybody's day-to-day life but not many people really understand how it works.

Are you interested in opening a line of credit in order to start a business, finance your education, consolidate debt, or live a dream?    Would you like to learn the pros and cons of home equity lines of credit versus home equity loans?      With this guide, you will learn what a home equity loan or line of credit is, and what to look for in a bank as you apply for one.    You&#x2019;ll also learn the best uses for a home equity loan and why home equity loans offer better interest rates and larger lines of credit than a traditional credit card.     Many people today struggle with credit card debt, or want to start a business or go back to school, but do not have access to the money to accomplish these things.   By using one of the biggest assets you have, your home, you can gain access to lines of credit to solve some of these problems!    As you learn about home equity loans, you will discover the advantages to using home equity loans to pay off credit cards or go back to school since you usually get them at a lower interest rate.    You will also learn the disadvantages and risks of home equity loans, such as spending too much of the line of credit if you are an impulsive spender, or the fact that your home is used as collateral if you default on your payments.

The solution revealed is in nearly everyone's best interest. The Light Yoke shows how to remove the heavy yoke of bank debt by making dividend payments to all citizens and expanding consumer subsidies. The analysis includes published information from the USA and the Reserve Bank of Australia and current population figures with web links.The cost burden of servicing bank debt becomes a heavy yoke on all societies that accept commercial trading bank credit as a valid addition to their money supply. In 1978 the Bank of New South Wales revealingly published that&#58; All money is a debt of the banking system. In other words, the commercial trading banks create and issue all money. They claim this new money as their own and lend it at interest to borrowers. We are in effect using a rented money supply and under current practices, there can be no end to the accumulating debt.Currently there are only three sources of money with which to repay bank debt. These are new bank loans, current deposits and cash. Whilst it is normal to use credit from someone's new bank loan to repay existing bank debts, new bank loans automatically create a matching debt, which grows with interest. Therefore, it is impossible for bank issued credit to reduce total bank debt and commercial trading banks cannot solve the debt crisis. We need money to repay and thus cancel bank debt, without borrowing more money. To some extent, foreign income achieves this. Foreign income does result in additional deposits yet no additional local debt. This helps explain the typical government enthusiasm for exports, tourists and foreign investment. Foreign investment is a euphemism for the sale of assets to foreigners. Foreign income can only be a temporary fix. A lasting solution requires a better understanding of our situation. Government can restrict the further creation of credit by the commercial trading banks but the result is similar to a banker-imposed credit squeeze. Only current deposits and cash are then available to repay existing bank debts. The result at some level is a debt crisis. To solve the debt crisis another supply of credit money needs to be issued that refunds into the community the money cancelled by the repayment of bank debt. Whilst this is not technically difficult, the question of ownership and control of the new money should be of vital concern to every citizen. A simple and undeniably fair way to maintain a stable money supply (money stock) whilst at the same time paying down existing bank debt will be to give to all citizens a fair share of new money as it is issued. The rate of issue and distribution of new money should match the reduction rate of total bank debt. In effect, the new money will replace bank issued credit, which will be phased out of circulation. The additional supply of money will be indistinguishable from bank issued credit. Some of the new money should also fund consumer subsidies on local products. Consumer subsidies make local products cost less and so be more competitive against the flood of imports from low wage and slave wage states or from countries that subsidize exports. Issuing money that is debt free, interest free and tax free to all citizens will avert any contraction in the economy during the ongoing repayment of bank debts. In Australia, Reserve Bank figures, help show that the money supply and associated bank debts are around $60,000 per person. In other words, about $60,000 is your legitimate equal share of new money that all citizens should receive during the process of repaying total bank debt. This book reveals in simple terms that dividends paid to all citizens and consumer subsidies are fair and democratic ways to decentralize the corrupting power of money and transform the heavy yoke of bank debt into the light yoke of economic freedom and a democratized money supply.", "title": "The Light Yoke: Debunking Banking - How to remove the heavy burden of bank debt with dividend payments to all citizens.

But, along with its use comes huge financial responsibility. This is not meant to be killjoy, just sound advice so you&#x2019;ll get a proper handle of things from the very start. With sound advice you can avoid difficult credit card problems in future and keep enjoying the perks that a good credit card can give you. The most important detail to remember is that a credit card is borrowed money. So, as we&#x2019;ve been taught once upon a time, we have the obligation to return what we borrow. To be able to return what we borrow, in the time and terms we agreed when we accepted the credit card contract, we borrow only what we can afford to return. Borrowing from your credit card and paying the amount in the approved manner can help build your good credit rating and save you from a load of credit card debts in the long run. Hence, for the first-time credit card user it becomes important to understand how your credit card works so you can use it well. This book will give information on choosing the best credit card deal and applying for the right credit card. Also, it will outline the framework of a credit card statement and contract so you get the idea of how, when and what to pay so you can keep your credit card in good standing all the time.", "title": "A Credit Card Guide For First-Time Credit Card Users: Get Full Details On Getting A Credit Card, Types Of Credit Cards And Credit Card Fees To Help Yo", "price": {}, "catalogId": "5879", "advertiserName": "Barnes & Noble", "imageLink": "https://prodimage.barnesandnoble.com/pimages/2940012359636_p0_v2_s192x300.jpg", "link": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/a-credit-card-guide-for-first-time-credit-card-users-nelson-y-yost/1113891861?ean=2940012359636", "id": "2940012359636", "categoryName": "Home Games Business"}, {"description": "Banks Based in Washington : Credit Unions of Washington (U.

Using these cards, it is so easy to charge almost anything, or get cash from an ATM, or immediately debit an account, or make a phone call. But how many of us understand the way these cards work? What is the cost of credit? The credit-card industry is big business, and young people are among those most targeted with offers of their very own credit cards. A student may go off to college armed with several cards. True, the application states that an individual must be eighteen years or older in order to be issued a card. It goes into detail regarding annual percentage rate charges and credit limits. However, nowhere does it explain that easy credit may mean easy trouble. Ann Weiss explores the history of credit from its use in ancient times, to the early development of diner's cards and bankcards, to today's prestige cards and the like. Throughout the book, card users tell their stories of credit used wisely and unwisely. Some have borrowed to go to college, start a business, or buy a home. Others have ruined their credit ratings, even declared bankruptcy. Easy Credit also considers the regulations placed upon the cred-it-card industry and the need to preserve a card user's privacy. It discusses borrowing in general and lists places that provide help to people in serious debt. The book ends in a timely way with a chapter on consumer education. Easy Credit provides a wealth of information to help you understand credit and how to use those convenient plastic cards responsibly.", "title": "Easy Credit Ann E.

How MUCH is ENOUGH!!!Collateralised Credit Exploitation as practised on AAA None Defaulting accounts is in effect an Annuity in Perpetuity and is demonstrably Exploitative by Design -Extortionate by Intent - Fraudulent by Nature.Our political & regulatory & financial establishment has demonstrated endogenously heterodoxical behaviour in their collective incapacity to respect the UK Citizen by ignoring the fact of and the damage caused by Collateralised Credit Exploitation. 1Exploitative By Design - Extortionate By Intent - Fraudulent By NatureBillions will be repaid to Millions' estimated cost to Credit Card Companies of Collateralised Credit Exploitation is conservatively put at between &pound;50-75 Billion. Collateralised Credit Exploitation by Credit Card Companies is the cynical long term exploitation of vulnerable customers where there is no risk and no probability of risk to Credit Card Companies who perpetuate the practice. One Example amongst millions, follows;New Day Opus &pound; 110,000 gross on 10,000 @ 48.1% over 20 years*New Day Marbles &pound; 84,000 gross on 9,000 @ 39.9% over 20 years*Capital One &pound; 27,000 gross on 2.500 @ 31.1% over 20 years*MBNA &pound; 76,000 gross on 8,000 @ 30.0% over 20 years*,&pound; 46,000 gross on 5.000 @ 30.0% over 20 years*,&pound; 12,000 gross on 3,000 @ 30.0% over 20 years*BarclayCard &pound; 43,000 gross on 5.500 @ 26.5% over 20 years*&pound; 20,000 gross on 3,000 @ 26.5% over 20 years*RBS &pound; 85,000 gross on 14,000 @ 16.9% over 20 years*&pound; 503,000 to be repaid on &pound; 54,000*Each Credit Card to confirm exact extortion period & exploitative interest rate.All amounts above are PLUS interest, charges, fees, fines & compensation conservatively creating a &pound;754.500 Collateralised Credit Exploitation Liability on 1) on six credit card companies (above) on 2) nine numbered cards over 20 exemplary years. Base Rate 0.25% to 0.50%. Credit Card Companies have been allowed to insidiously develop over time a purposefully distorted Credit Risk Analysis Model which effectively penalizes their best customers & imbalances the relationship between avaricious providers & vulnerable users of credit instruments. Collateralized Credit Exploitation clearly demonstrates that the 'Value at Risk' nexus does NOT exist for the Credit Card Company & that they are imposing unreasonable and extortionate charges onto the consumer. Rather than 'know' they are 'ignoring the rights & abasing the needs' of their customers.", "title": "Billions will be REPAID to Millions - TimeOutCreditCards - Marcellino Castrillo: Collateralised Credit Exploitation as practised on AAA None Defaultin", "price": {}, "catalogId": "5879", "advertiserName": "Barnes & Noble", "imageLink": "https://prodimage.barnesandnoble.com/pimages/9781717863935_p0_v1_s192x300.jpg", "link": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/billions-will-be-repaid-to-millions-timeoutcreditcards-marcellino-castrillo-mact-mba-mres-msc-danny-molon-mapce/1129142272?ean=9781717863935", "id": "9781717863935", "categoryName": "Society Business Health"}, {"description": "There are three main types of money&#58; currency, bank deposits, and central bank reserves. ...Most money in the modern economy is in the form of bank deposits, which are created by commercial banks themselves. Bank of England, Money in the Modern Economy (2014)The most outstanding fact of the last depression is the destruction of 8 billion dollars - over a third - of our check-book money - demand deposits. Irving Fisher, 100% Money and the Public Debt (1936)The process by which banks create money is so simple that the mind is repelled. John K Galbraith, Money&#58; Whence it Came, Where it Went (1975)Commercial banks create the money supply in the form of the deposit account money supply&#58; by making repayable loans of newly-created bank deposits to private sector loan account debtors and to government bond debtors.Making a bank loan or bond purchase creates a linked pair of credits/debts&#58; a new spendable, cashable, credit balance (a new bank deposit&#58; e.g. +$1000) in the debtor's bank deposit account; and an equal new interest-bearing repayable debt balance (-$1000) in the debtor's bank loan or bond account.Debtors spend their new bank loans and bond sale proceeds.Debtors pay the new credit balances to payees - by check, direct deposit, online banking, debit card, etc - within the bank-operated payments system of debiting payer accounts and crediting payee accounts.The new credit balances are debited out of the debtors' bank deposit accounts and credited into the first payees' bank deposit accounts.That's where the deposit account money supply - the spendable, investible, savable (and cashable) credit balances in our bank deposit accounts - comes from, in the first place.Then payees create the spendable cash money supply by making cash withdrawals, and paying with debits to our deposit account credit balances.But most bank deposits are never cashed out.Most money never exists in any other form than credit balances in payees' bank deposit accounts.Debtors owe all the credit balances back to their creditor-banks, as payment of the debtors' loan account and bond debt balances.Repaying a bank loan; or redeeming a bank-held bond; un-creates - extinguishes; cancels out to $0/$0 - the deposit account credit balance (+$1000) and the loan account or bond debt balance (-$1000) that were created by making the bank loan or bond purchase.The deposit account money supply - which is over 95% of all money that exists - only exists so long as debtors' debts remain unpaid. But debtors can't pay their loan account and bond debts because payees have all the deposit account money.The Road to Debt Bondage describes how the commercial banks' debt-based repayable bank loan and bond purchase money supply creation monopoly creates ever-increasing totals of payees' bank deposit account balances that are owed back to banks as payment of debtors' unpayable loan account and bond debts, until debtors finally default en masse and the banking system descends into a financial crisis of creditors' uncollectable money that is owed as debtors' unpayable debts.Financial crisis is historically resolved by writing off our bank deposit account balances to relieve the commercial banking system of its unpayable deposit liability debts.Which is what bankruptcy Trustees did in the 1930s, and the Dodd-Frank depositor bail-ins program plans to do this time.Which plunges the spending-driven producer-consumer economy into Debt-Deflation Depression by writing off ruinous amounts of commercial banks' unpayable deposit liability debts - which used to be our spendable deposit account money supply.Monetary system reform - government issuance of debt-free (non-repayable) money that breaks the banks' longstanding monopoly of debt-based money supply issuance - can solve the unpayable debts problem, prevent banking system failure, and eliminate the need to write off our 'money in the bank'.", "title": "The Road to Debt Bondage: How Banks Create Unpayable Debt Derryl Hermanutz Author", "price": {}, "catalogId": "5879", "advertiserName": "Barnes & Noble", "imageLink": "https://prodimage.barnesandnoble.com/pimages/9781725895249_p0_v2_s192x300.jpg", "link": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-road-to-debt-bondage-derryl-hermanutz/1129388090?ean=9781725895249", "id": "9781725895249", "categoryName": "Society Business Home"}, {"description": "&quot;Credit Rating&quot; originated in the USA has spread out to the world since the 1980s.

The Ex-Im Bank also may assist U.S. exporters to meet foreign, officially sponsored, export credit competition. Its main programs are direct loans, loan guarantees, working capital guarantees, and export credit insurance. Ex-Im Bank transactions are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

Shock waves from one Wall Street scandal after another have completely disillusioned us with our banking system; yet we cannot do without banks. Nearly all money today is simply bank credit. Economies run on it, and it is created when banks make loans. The main flaw in the current model is that private profiteers have acquired control of the credit spigots. They can cut off the flow, direct it to their cronies, and manipulate it for personal gain at the expense of the producing economy. The benefits of bank credit can be maintained while eliminating these flaws, through a system of banks operated as public utilities, serving the public interest and returning their profits to the public.

So if you are in the position to just start learning the ropes of the world of credit cards, there are a lot of things you can do to avoid credit card debt before it sneaks up on you and keep your nose clean, as they say.This is an outstanding goal for you if you are just getting your first credit cards. If you know or talk to anyone who is battling tens of thousands of dollars of credit card debt, you know what a jail sentence it can be. Once that credit card debt gets that high, the time it will take even under the best of conditions to bring it down runs into the years if not decades. And for all that time, thousands of dollars of money goes down the drain to credit interest that doesn't buy you any food, tickets to the movies or new clothes. It just goes away with no value to you at all.But if you are new to the world of credit, getting a credit card is a good thing. But once you get one, keeping it under control is job one. You will find it amazingly easy to use a credit card once it comes. In fact, the retail world makes it difficult to conduct transactions any other way. You can pay for gas at the pump that way and even charge your groceries at the grocery store. And while all of these great uses for credit are helpful, you can end up with a whopper of a credit card bill at the end of the month. And if you don't pay that bill off, that is the first step on a lifelong jail term in credit card debt jail.So there are some guidelines you should follow to both use credit responsibly but also to keep building your credit rating which has a real value to you. Remember that what the credit card companies don't tell you is that making a charge on a credit card is a loan. Even if you just charge ten bucks to go to the movies, you took out an unsecured loan to finance that movie ticket. So once you start using a credit card, keep in mind that you will be paying back everything you run up on it. It is NOT free money. A good practice is to save every receipt every month and keep a running tally of what you have spent on credit. Now only can you use that to cross check your credit card, it keeps you honest because each time you add a charge to your credit card, you can update your tally so you know for certain that you will be able to pay it off when the bill comes.Paying off the credit card each month is the number one best way to keep your credit problems under control. Now it isn't a bad idea to let a little bit of the debt drift from month to month. This builds your credit history and credit rating which will pay you well down the road when you want to buy a larger purchase. But by staying on top of your credit and what is going onto your card, you will start out with the kind of habits that will lead to a life of good credit use without credit card jail. And that is a wonderful gift to give yourself early in life.", "title": "Credit Card Debt: Everything You Need to Know to Avoid the Mistakes Haytham Al Fiqi Author", "price": {}, "catalogId": "5879", "advertiserName": "Barnes & Noble", "imageLink": "https://prodimage.barnesandnoble.com/pimages/9781523660094_p0_v1_s192x300.jpg", "link": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/credit-card-debt-haytham-al-fiqi/1123312152?ean=9781523660094", "id": "9781523660094", "categoryName": "Home Games Business"}, {"description": "Institutions of higher education, alumni groups, and other affiliated organizations may enter into agreements with credit card issuers for college affinity cards, in which issuers use the institution's name or logo in exchange for payments.

Partly in response to concerns about card issuer practices and rising student credit card debt, Congress passed the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009. The act includes consumer protections and requires disclosures specifically for consumers under the age of 21, including limits to on-campus credit card marketing and requirements for public disclosure of affinity card agreements. The act mandates that GAO review these agreements and assess their effect on student credit card debt.This report examines (1) trends associated with and characteristics of college affinity card agreements, (2) the extent of marketing for college affinity cards and college student credit cards, and (3) what is known about the effect of use of these cards on student credit card debt.

Shock waves from one Wall Street scandal after another have completely disillusioned us with our banking system; yet we cannot do without banks. Nearly all money today is simply bank credit. Economies run on it, and it is created when banks make loans. The main flaw in the current model is that private profiteers have acquired control of the credit spigots. They can cut off the flow, direct it to their cronies, and manipulate it for personal gain at the expense of the producing economy. The benefits of bank credit can be maintained while eliminating these flaws, through a system of banks operated as public utilities, serving the public interest and returning their profits to the public. This book looks at the public bank alternative, and shows with examples from around the world and through history that it works admirably well, providing the key to sustained high performance for the economy and well-being for the people.", "title": "The Public Bank Solution: From Austerity to Prosperity Ellen Brown Author", "price": {}, "catalogId": "5879", "advertiserName": "Barnes & Noble", "imageLink": "https://prodimage.barnesandnoble.com/pimages/2940148291602_p0_v1_s192x300.jpg", "link": "https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-public-bank-solution-ellen-hodgson-brown/1115667757?ean=2940148291602", "id": "2940148291602", "categoryName": "Society Business Computers"}, {"description": "This annual publication provides an overview of the most important developments in global credit markets and the regulatory landscape.
