We plan to implement our website using ReactJS.

Notes on ReactJS for web dev:

Pros:
1. Using a component structure, which allows you to dynamically structure a web page
2. Virtual DOM in ReactJS makes user experience better and developerâ€™s work faster
3. Ability to reuse components between pages makes web development a lot faster and smoother
4. Data flows in 1 direction making the code more stable
5. We can use Redux to store the state of a page in containers

Cons:
1. There is poor documentation, making the learning curve steep
2. High page of development can add to the learning curve

Conclusion:
After reading up on ReactJS, and having some experience working with it, we think that using React for our web app will be useful. It may take a while for all of us to get used to the environment and comfortable coding with it, but we think it will be worth it because there are many more pros than cons when using React.
