Rigi Train and Cable Car Round Trip Ticket from Vitznau / Weggis","description":"The Rigi Railways cogwheel train station is conveniently located across the road from the Lake Lucerne ferry pier. In general, departures are timed to coincide with the arrival of the ferry service, so if you are arriving by steamboat ferry, you will not have to wait long.Once seated on the train, get ready for the jaw-dropping views of Lake Lucerne framed by the beautiful Alps.

The cable car ride is included in your combination ticket. From the cable car station it&#039;s a clearly marked, 15-minute walk down to the Weggis ferry pier.You can also take the cogwheel train from Rigi Kulm to the Rigi Kaltbad stop, then walk to the Weggis-Rigi Kaltbad Aerial Cable Car.
