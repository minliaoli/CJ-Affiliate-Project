The higher you ascend, the more spectacular the views.Take the train to the final stop: Rigi Kulm. There is a short trail to the highest point on the mountain, boasting the best panoramic views.Coming down from the top of the mountain, you have several options. We recommend hiking down the scenic trail from Rigi Kulm to Rigi Kaltbad Hotel (app. 45 minutes), then taking the cable car at Rigi Kaltbad down to Weggis. The cable car ride is included in your combination ticket. From the cable car station it&#039;s a clearly marked, 15-minute walk down to the Weggis ferry pier.You can also take the cogwheel train from Rigi Kulm to the Rigi Kaltbad stop, then walk to the Weggis-Rigi Kaltbad Aerial Cable Car. The cable car ride is included in your combination ticket. From the cable car station it&#039;s a clearly marked, 15-minute walk down to the Weggis ferry pier.Those less inclined to venture beyond the scenic viewpoints can head back to the train station at Rigi Kulm, and board the next train returning to Vitznau.", "title": "Mt.
