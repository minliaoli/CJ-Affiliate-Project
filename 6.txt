 The Dark Crystal is finally coming to PC and consoles in the form of a tactical turn-based RPG. Based on the classic Jim Henson film and the Netflix series, you control a group of Gelfling fighters in the fantasy land of Thra. Your quest is to stop the spread of the darkening and the evil Skeksis who have seized control of the Crystal. Unite the seven clans in this nostalgic adventure that’ll get your 80s Nostalg-o-meter spiking. The story follows the Netflix series where Thra is still populated by different Gelfling clans before the genocidal culling of the Skeksis. However, if you still want to hear Chamberlain’s creepy whimper then it looks like there are still plenty of Skeksis to see, as you lead a resistance against these oppressive overlords who begin to dominate the land of Thra. There are more than 50 tactical turn-based battles for you to enjoy with 150 base abilities to use in combat. Choose from 14 playable characters that can be customized with unique gear for specific fights. The mechanics look similar to the Xcom style grid system where the environments are used to shield you from attack. There are three primary jobs that your character can choose from which are soldier, scout, and mender. These can be leveled up as you progress to more advanced ones such as Strategist, Song Teller, and Grave Dancer. But don’t worry the squishy Podlings and fluffy Fizzgigs have their own abilities too. Aughra the cranky astronomer also makes an appearance in the gameplay, but it’s unclear whether she’s an NPC or not. The Dark Crystal Age of Resistance Tactics looks like an enjoyable nostalgic romp for any lovers of the original dark fantasy film or Netflix series. However, you’ll have to wait and see if its RPG mechanics and gameplay can match its cult status. The Dark Crystal Age of Resistance Tactics will be released on February 4, 2020.+++6
 Save From the same developer that brought us Mars Underground earlier this year, Shadows and Dust is a short indie game based on the creator’s nightmares. Players take on the role of a disembodied consciousness. As the game progresses, it is revealed that this consciousness is the deceased father of a little boy. Be warned, this game deals with themes of suicide, suicidal ideation in a child, and other dark imagery related to mental illness. Gameplay takes two forms- navigating a bare room and visual-novel-like interactions with the little boy. Each portion with the little boy shows a number on its title screen- not a chapter number, but the age of the boy. It starts at four, then six, and so on. The boy himself will note early on that these encounters occur his birthday every other year. His dialogue focuses mostly on how much he misses father and features some really uncomfortable questions, like “why did you leave?” and “is it nice where you are?” If the game is intended to show the father’s hauntings alternating with his afterlife, then it’s not very nice where he is. The other part of the game allows the player to move around a confined space- almost like a hotel room. There’s a bed, a small table next to a picture window, and a long, low cabinet with a phone on it. This room remains the same… mostly. The view outside the window changes, and the door, which at first has no handle, seems to grow one piece by piece. The interactions available in this room are the light switch, the bed (which triggers the next encounter with the boy), and the phone and door. The phone will not stop ringing, and someone is knocking at the door. This never stops. When the phone is selected, the knocking continues. When the door is selected, the phone keeps ringing. The entities never identify themselves, and although the dialogue options often feature the question “Who is this?” they do not receive a response. At first, the questions coming over the phone and from the other side of the door seem benevolently concerned: “Are you okay?” “Are you on your way?” “Are you coming out?” However, they quickly become annoyed, and then outright hostile, finally goading the player to kill themselves. This escalation corresponds with the little boy revealing first that his father committed suicide, then that the boy himself is beginning to feel symptoms of depression and the desire to isolate himself from others, and finally that the father committed suicide on the boy’s second birthday. Again, the door handle is at first missing, so it is impossible to open the door even if the player wants to do so. Certain dialogue paths will allow the player to communicate this with the entity on the other side of the door. This leads to possibly the most chilling response of all. The person on the other side of the door just laughs. And then leaves. And then starts knocking again. When the boy turns twelve, he tells his father’s ghost that he shouldn’t return again. The boy wants to move on. Hypothetically, this should be a happy ending. The game returns to the room. The scenery outside the window has returned to a solid gray mass. The phone is off the hook. The lightswitch no longer works. The door handle is complete. It opens onto darkness. Pressing forward and braving a few large, eyes in the black, rewards the player with a birthday party in the kitchen. Balloons, cake… the big staring eyes still there, but it’s still a party so I guess they’re part of it? But take another step towards the kitchen table, it gets further away. And further away. And further. There are a couple of other secrets to this game that I don’t want to give away. The last thing I’ll say is that there is exactly one achievement for this game and you get it when you quit. As someone who has suffered from mental illness for a long time, and who watched a parent suffer from the same mental illness (thankfully neither of us from suicidal ideation) this hit home for me in a lot of ways. The feeling that the only way you can escape is by going back to sleep, that no one can hear you or understand that there’s nothing you can do to help yourself no matter how many times they say it. Or even the replacement of “other people” with toxic, intrusive thoughts that come back, again and again, no matter how many times you address them. Gameplay can be relatively short depending on how long you take to explore the environment, but I pondered the game long after I was done. I asked myself if I was playing as the father, the son, or both. If the entire game took place in the afterlife or in the mind of a character. If the choices I made in dialogue made a difference. If any of the choices I made had an impact at all in the outcome of the game. I still don’t have definitive answers and I’m not sure if I’m supposed to. I will caution sufferers of certain disorders that this game could put you in a bad headspace. Don’t play alone. This is a horror game, not a therapeutic one. If you’re looking for a more positive game dealing with this subject, I recommend Depression Quest or Night in the Woods. This review is based on a retail copy of the game provided by the publisher.+++6
I want you to pause and re-read that headline again. Capcom, one of the most influential game developers of the past 30+ years, creators of mega franchises like Street Fighter and Resident Evil, has just had its sales record smashed. Monster Hunter World, which was released in January of 2018, has broken 14 million sales shortly after the release of its major DLC, Iceborne, as reported by the official Twitter page. Monster Hunter has always been one of Capcom’s more niche franchises, especially in North America, as the entries from PS2 to 3DS had carved out some modest success. The franchise’s previous top seller was Monster Hunter Freedom 3 on the PSP with 4.9 Million in sales. Monster Hunter’s previous sales are certainly nothing to scoff at, but they’ve not exactly made the brand a household name. Monster Hunter World Monster Hunter World offers up many beautiful areas to slay wildlife. That is until World and its newcomer friendly attitude. Previous games in the series could be seen as having a steep learning curve that pushes away incoming players to the series. In World, the mechanics are laid out in an accessible manner, there are guides readily available, and the ease of matchmaking online make taking down your first monsters a blast any level of gamer can enjoy. This type of accessibility has helped propel Monster Hunter World to the very top of the sales charts for Capcom. Technically, Street Fighter 2 and all of its remakes and ports combined have sold more than Monster Hunter World’s 14 million. When it comes to just a base game’s performance, World has been an excellent sales performer and with the addition of the Iceborne DLC and many more to come, World is providing all of the gigantic monster slaying you could dream of. +++6
I do like a good puzzle game and this is exactly why Creature in the Well took my fancy. We’ll obviously be going into the game in more depth but in a nutshell it’s brilliant … if you don’t mind a bit of finger cramp. “Cramped fingers!” I hear you say. “Why would we want those?” Well this isn’t just a puzzler it’s a pin-brawler and that involves skill and accuracy and lots of clicking … and therefore, cramp! So what’s a pin-brawler then? For this to make sense we need to go back a step and tell you a wee bit about Creature in the Well‘s plot. You will be taking the roll of the last Bot-C. You’re basically a caretaker of sorts, or at least you were until something horrible happened and you were disabled. You wake to find yourself in the desert near the town of Mirage which is surrounded by a permanent sand-storm. The storm is so bad that the inhabitants don’t believe anything else exists outside their home. You get the impression from the off that The Creature is very happy keeping it this way. You’re introduced to this being pretty much immediately but you don’t know a great deal about it other than it’s keeping a close eye on the village and that it doesn’t like intruders in its mountain. This is one of the simpler puzzles, they get a lot more complex. You need to go into the mountain an switch back on all the machinery that’s laying dormant there. You’ll do this by using charged energy balls to hit targets, knock out bumpers and deactivate turrets. All this will grant you the energy needed to open doors and move through the maze of rooms in the complex. Each area of the mountain belongs to a particular sub-system required for the machine to function. Each area also has it’s own puzzles that will need to be solved if you are to progress. Speaking of puzzles, something I like about the game is that a new zone doesn’t necessarily mean a totally unknown challenge. The difficulty builds by introducing new hazards as you go. So for example … you’ll start with basic bumpers, then turrets are added, then bumpers that fire energy beams and so on. Each new area adds something different and this means that a definite difficulty curve is established. The game gets harder without throwing you anything so new that you don’t know what you’re doing. Each monolith is a level. You decide how you tackle them. Completing puzzle rooms earns you energy. You’ll need this to open doors around the complex and different doors require different amounts of power. Energy is something that should be treated as a currency. You’ll not only need it to re-power the machine but also upgrade your Bot. Although I wouldn’t call Creature in the Well a metroidvania style game as such it certainly has that feel. Not all of the puzzles need to be solved to allow progression and some are certainly more difficult than others. You get the sense that going back when you’re stronger is sometimes a better idea than just battering away at the same thing and not getting anywhere . You’ll find bot cores as you go and use these to upgrade yourself. Being faster, more accurate and having more life is an absolute bonus when trying to complete the different areas. Some puzzle rooms will open secret passages too which might yield some very useful gear. You upgrade your Bot here. You just need the cores and the energy to level yourself. The levels don’t need to be completed in any exact order. After the first level you can choose which way round you’d like to complete the zones and they open in steps a bit like a tree. After the first zone you get a choice of two, then five and so on. All levels on each tier need completing before you move on but the choice of order is yours. This is really important in later stages as some zones are definitely harder going than others if you’re ill equipped or skilled. Being able to dart out of one into another is a big help in progression. Your main antagonist is The Creature and the boss battles you’ll find yourself in are different and fun. You’ll have to remember what you’ve learned in the zone you’ve just completed as you’ll be facing similar puzzles as part of that end arena. You’ll find yourself on an elevator and the battle is in steps. When you complete one set of puzzles the elevator will go up a level and you’ll get a different set to complete. These battles are also a bit unique because on top of the usual mayhem of everything trying to blast you to bits you have the Creature interfering in it’s own insidious ways. Creature in the Well is full of secrets. Think you can find them all? This is a game of skill more than anything and definitely one of multi-tasking. Each puzzle has it’s own hazards and standing in the wrong place can be deadly. I was doing very well on one for instance until an unexpected pair of bumpers popped out of the ground and I was standing in an energy beam … then I wasn’t standing anywhere. So that’s a bit of an overview of the story and what you’re doing. Now let’s have a bit of a think about nuts and bolts … and a few of my general misgivings. First off I think some form of in-level save would be nice. The game autosaves as you unlock new areas so you can go back to them with ease, which is good but it doesn’t let you save your position. When you die you get unceremoniously grabbed by the creature and dumped back in town. This means trecking back to wherever you were killed from the start of that zone. This doesn’t effect the gameplay or the fun it’s just a bit of a pain in the rear if you’re struggling a being killed a lot. I’m not asking for the ability to save at the drop of a hat but an unlockable save point that you need to find would be handy. You’re always being watched My second gripe is that your aim doesn’t always feel fluid. There are weapons that you’ll find with various abilities that help this immensely but too often you feel that you should be on target and miss what you’re going for by inches. When there are a lot of things that are trying to kill you your accuracy is paramount and I’m not sure it’s always there. This could of course be blamed on lack of player skill but I don’t necessarily believe this is the entire cause of the issue. Creature in the Well looks great and the story is really well written. You pick up information as you go which adds to overall feel and creates atmosphere. The fact that there really isn’t any narrator and a lot of the plot comes in written scraps that you’ll have to look for adds to an air of mystery which is definitely welcome. Incidentally … you might be wondering why this title is called Creature in the Well and not Creature in the Mountain. When you’re in the town you’ll find a well and you can see the Creature peering out from it’s depths. This is also where you’re dropped when getting booted out of the mountain after you die. There is method to the madness here. The controls are fine with the exception of the aiming issues I mentioned earlier. You aim with the mouse so this could actually be part of the problem, it only takes the slightest wrong movement and you’re suddenly way off your mark. Other than this everything controls really well so no complaints there. All in all this is a clever, innovative take on the action genre. The pinball elements are the core of the game, not a throw away idea that’s been implemented as a gimmick. The fact that you won’t solve every puzzle on your first run adds replayability and you know that as you upgrade your Bot some of those puzzles are going to get easier. It’s worth trying to complete everything to unlock all the secrets. With this being said the game could also probably be completed relatively quickly by a skillful player just wanting to follow the main story without all the hidden bits. Action fans amongst you looking for a bit of a change should definitely give Creature in the Well a try. It’s a really clever puzzle, pinball, dungeon-crawling hybrid that really needs to be played to be understood properly. I don’t actually feel like I’ve done the game justice here, seeing is definitely believing in this instance.+++6

But as good as these phones are, many of the very best phones for games aren’t even billed as gaming phones, they’re simply high-power flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus and iPhone 11 Pro Max, the latter of which also benefits from access to the stupendous game library of the App Store, and exclusives on Apple Arcade. And over in Android land far more great gaming handsets are soon to launch – the Samsung Galaxy S11 is being announced on February 11, and many more top-tier Android handsets are likely to land a couple of weeks later at MWC 2020.

Those perks will give you more of an edge than with the iPhone 11 Pro, but both benefit from this Apple phone generation's true advantage: the A13 Bionic processor. In our tests, it loaded up Clash Royale and PUBG even faster (vs the iPhone X), and speed is crucial in online gaming.

The camera and display aren't nearly as impressive as other phones that cost this much, so casual gamers might want to look elsewhere. But if you're more serious about mobile gaming and can afford it, this is a solid choice. Outwardly, the Razer Phone 2 hasn't changed much from its predecessor, though it's upgraded to the Snapdragon 845 chip and switched to a glass back for Qi wireless charging. It's also added a slick vapor chamber to cool the device as you game. At the end of the day, the phone's beefy chipset, 8GB RAM, great speakers, 120hz refresh rate screen and 4,000mAh battery, as well as extensive settings to tweak battery life and performance, make this a great choice for gaming.

And, while it may have a smaller screen, it's still offering 6.1 inches. Even though that lower price comes with caveats, like a simpler camera setup, the iPhone XR doesn't skimp on internals. It packs the same A12 Bionic chipset that's found in the more expensive models, and it runs iOS 13 just the same as the other models. That means it can play all the same games, and it can run them just as smoothly (if not even smoother, since it has fewer pixels to push). The iPhone XR also has one of the best batteries in an iPhone that we've seen in some time. So, if you want to do plenty of gaming on iOS, the iPhone XR is a strong option.

Here are the best graphics cards for your gaming PC, from high-end top performance models to budget GPUs. COMMENTS The best graphics cards in 2020 (Image credit: MSI) The ongoing battle between AMD and Nvidia to create the best graphics card rages on. From extreme performance GPUs capable of pushing 4K resolutions and maximum quality settings to budget models fit for 1080p and modest settings, we've tested and selected the best graphics cards for your gaming pleasure. Last year, AMD was the first to release a 7nm GPU with it's Radeon VII, RX 5700 series, and RX 5500 XT cards. Nvidia countered with updated 'Super' models of its RTX series, along with its GTX 16-series. This year, things should be even more interesting. AMD will have its first ray tracing capable GPUs, Nvidia will launch 7nm GPUs, and Intel will be joining the fray. But all of those are future developments; we're looking at the here and now. Before looking at an upgrade graphics card, you should also consider the rest of the system. Check our AMD vs Intel to learn more about the two CPU juggernauts, or look at our guide to the best CPUs for gaming. Also consider that AMD's latest RX 5000 series cards support PCIe Gen4, which also requires an AMD X570 motherboard and a Ryzen 3000 series CPU. We've updated several of our picks following the launch of AMD's RX 5600 XT, RX 5500 XT, and Nvidia's GTX 1660 and 1650 super. Those fall in the budget to mid-range categories, while the high-end and extreme performance remain largely unchanged. The RTX 2080 Ti continues its reign as the king of GPUs, and likely will until Nvidia's RTX 3080 arrives. But if you're looking for a more balanced option in your high-end gaming PC, the GTX 1660 Super is a good choice, or the GTX 1650 Super if you're after a budget solution. We also have a colossal list of all current GPUs in order of performance, in our full graphics card hierarchy. (Image credit: MSI) 1. Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Ti The best graphics card in 2019 GPU Cores: 4,352 | Base Clock: 1,350MHz | Boost Clock: 1,545MHz | GFLOPS: 13,448 | Memory: 11GB GDDR6 | Memory Clock: 14 GT/s | Memory Bandwidth: 616GB/s Fastest graphics card aroundRay tracing and deep learning techMore developers moving to embrace ray tracingExtravagantly priced2080 Super has closed the power gap Nvidia's GeForce RTX 2080 Ti is the latest and most potent GPU around, and it's also one of the largest consumer GPUs ever produced. The Turing TU102 is 60 percent larger than the Pascal GP102 in the 1080 Ti, with 55 percent more transistors. Those extra transistors went into more CUDA cores, but Nvidia didn't stop there, adding in Tensor cores to help accelerate deep learning algorithms like DLSS, plus RT cores to accelerate ray tracing. There are plenty of other enhancements in the Turing architecture as well, but if you want the best, be prepared to shell out: the cheapest 2080 Ti cards start at $999, with many selling for $1,199 and up. Technically there's also the Titan RTX, which more than doubles the price of the 2080 Ti, but it's more of a prosumer card that anything we'd recommend for pure gaming purposes. If you're looking for the best value, forget about the new RTX cards. On the other hand, if you're eyeing a 4k 144Hz HDR G-Sync display and you want the absolute fastest graphics card around, this is the card for you. You could even try adding a second card and using an NVLink connector, assuming you just won the lottery. (Note that the current ray tracing enabled games do not support multi-GPU with DXR (DirectX Raytracing) enabled, so we don't recommend this!) We're unlikely to see anything substantially faster for at least a year, so you'll be able to sit comfortably at the top of the pecking order for a while. The biggest issue with DXR and RTX hardware right now is that lack of games, although this problem is getting less and less significant. There were a few major games when these cards first launched (Battlefield 5, Assetto Corsa Competezione, Metro Exodus, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider), plus a few tech demos (Quake 2 with RT) and some overseas titles (Justice). But with Unreal Engine and Unity both supporting DXR, we should start seeing more ray tracing games later this year, and early next - Cyberpunk 2077 and the Call of Duty reboot have already announced they'll support ray tracing, with Control, Wolfenstein: Youngblood, recently adding it for their launches. MSI Radeon RX 570 Gaming X 4G (Image credit: Future) 2. AMD Radeon RX 570 4GB The best graphics card for 1080p on a budget GPU Cores: 2,048 | Base Clock: 1,168MHz | Boost Clock: 1,244MHz | GFLOPS: 5,095 | Memory: 4GB GDDR5 | Memory Clock: 7 GT/s | Memory Bandwidth: 224GB/s Good for 1080p gamingOften faster in DX12'Budget' pricingUses more power than GTX 1660/1060Only 4GB VRAM While nowhere near the top of our list for performance, this is a great value pick if you're looking to game on a budget. AMD's Polaris architecture has been around a few years, and while it's beginning to show its age, it's also significantly cheaper now than when it launched. It's an excellent card to tackle the current 1080p era of gaming, and if you're still leaning on integrated graphics or an older card, it's a cheap upgrade. Overall, the RX 570 4GB is a close match with Nvidia's GTX 1650 but falls behind the GTX 1650 Super. Game choice and settings are a factor, as well as current prices. Depending on where you live, it's a tossup between this and the 1650 Super. It draws more power than Nvidia's Turing-in-a-GTX-shell 16-series of cards and the 1060, but it can also regularly be had for $30-40 less than Nvidia's closer competitors. Most desktops are more than capable of running this 150W card without any difficulty, though you'll need at least a 6-pin power connector, or possibly an 8-pin connector. Sales often drop the price of RX 570 4GB cards to $110-$120, though with the launch of the RX 5500 XT supplies of Polaris may finally be drying up. Regardless, so as long as your PSU is up to snuff, the RX 570 pretty much kills off the market for anything lower. If you're building a budget PC or upgrading from an older, outdated GPU, the RX 570 is a great starting point. GeForce RTX 2080 Super graphics card (Image credit: Future) 3. Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super The best graphics card for 4K at a (fairly) reasonable price GPU Cores: 3,072 | Base Clock: 1,650MHz | Boost Clock: 1,815MHz | GFLOPS: 11,151 | Memory: 8GB GDDR6 | Memory Clock: 15.5 GT/s | Memory Bandwidth: 496GB/s Fantastic 1440p performance and respectable 4KRay tracing and deep learningFastest GDDR6 clocks availableNo groundbreaking new featureOnly slightly outperforms the vanilla 2080 Sure, the RTX 2080 Ti is the fastest graphics card and has all sorts of cool and potentially useful features, but at the current prices it's a tough pill to swallow. Dropping down to the new RTX 2080 Super will get you still excellent performance—it's the second fastest consumer GPU, edging out the base 2080 and GTX 1080 Ti—and save you a bunch of cash, as even the Founder's Edition retails for $700. And you still get the same ray tracing and deep learning (eg, DLSS) features, albeit not quite as many of each core type (though still more than the vanilla 2080). The one major caveat right now is that we're still waiting for more universal adoption of ray tracing and DLSS. We've got Battlefield 5, Metro Exodus, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Control (with unreleased games like Cyberpunk 2077 and the Call of Duty reboot recently climbing on the bandwagon). The RTX 2080 Super can run all of those games with ray tracing, though if you're looking for 4K Ultra and 60FPS the Super isn't quite there. Still, it can deliver very playable frame rates in the vast majority of triple-A titles at 4K, though on the extreme end you may need to tweak some settings down (Metro Exodus for instance, with its taxing global illumination ray tracing, is a strain). Even with a $700 GPU, 1440p typically works best at slightly reduced ray tracing quality mode and with DLSS enabled.

Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super The best graphics card for solid 4K RTX performance and price GPU Cores: 2,560 | Base Clock: 1,605MHz | Boost Clock: 1,770MHz | GFLOPS: 9,062 | Memory: 8GB GDDR6 | Memory Clock: 14 GT/s | Memory Bandwidth: 448GB/s Performance close to a 2080Same starting price as the base 2070 (no FE premium)Handles 4K at high/medium settings admirablyAs with the 2060, a very iterative release The ray tracing future may sound great, but what if you can't afford $700 or more on a graphics card? That's where Nvidia's RTX 2070 Super enters the picture, the middle option of the new lineup. The 2070 Super retails at $499, the same price as the vanilla 2070 at launch, and offers a substantial performance improvement. That's still a lot of money for a graphics card, and the old 2070 is only slightly faster than the previous generation 1080 Ti (see below), at least in games that don't support DLSS—which is still most games. The RTX 2070 Super moves to the TU104 chip from the base version's TU106, enables more cores, and increases clockspeeds. The performance bump is pretty predictable but also very welcome when it doesn't come with an increase in price. As a play to stay ahead of AMD's RX 5700 and 5700 XT launch, it's very convincing, though as a new product stack it's not earth-shaking. The 2070 Super can attack triple-A games at 4K if you're willing to turn down graphics settings to medium or high, and it does an excellent job of pushing more than 60 FPS at QHD. Needless to say, if you're got an incredibly high refresh monitor or TV, you can squeeze some very high rates out at 1080p Ultra. The 2070 Super may not be a revolution, but it's an excellent card at a very convincing price. Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super (Image credit: ©EVGA) 5. Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super The best graphics card for 1440p and 144hz FHD performance GPU Cores: 2,176 | Base Clock: 1,470MHz | Boost Clock: 1,650MHz | GFLOPS: 7,181 | Memory: 8GB GDDR6 | Memory Clock: 14 GT/s | Memory Bandwidth: 448GB/s Great for 1080p and 1440p gamingAffordably priced RTX featuresEffectively replaces the 2070 for $100 lessExtremely iterative The best graphics card isn't simply the fastest graphics card, or the cheapest graphics card. Instead, the best graphics card needs to balance performance, price, and features. There are many great graphics cards, but for a great GPU that won't break the bank, Nvidia's RTX 2060 Super is probably the best option. It delivers performance roughly equal to a vanilla RTX 2070 but retails for $100 less. If you want to play games at 1080p or 1440p on a 144Hz display, the 2060 Super has the chops to handle most games at close to high to ultra quality. It's about 10 percent faster than the previous generation GTX 1080, and basically matches AMD's new RX 5700 XT. For DXR and ray tracing games, 1080p with DLSS often works well, and in a few cases 1440p with DLSS. Don't be shy about turning the ray tracing setting down a notch as well, as in most games so far there's not much visual difference between ultra and high quality DXR modes. AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT (Image credit: ©AMD) 6. AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT The best graphics card for AMD performance and efficiency GPU Cores: 2,560 | Base Clock: 1,605MHz | Boost Clock: 1,905MHz | GFLOPS: 9,754 | Memory: 8GB GDDR6 | Memory Clock: 14 GT/s | Memory Bandwidth: 448GB/s Outperforms the 2060 Super for the same priceEfficient new RDNA architectureOften beats the Radeon VIINo ray tracing hardware or driver supportRuns a bit hot AMD's Radeon RX 5700 XT uses the Navi 10 GPU and is the first major 7nm GPU to hit the market. The 5700 XT is technically the middle offering, between the base 5700 and the 5700 XT 50th Anniversary Edition, and takes full advantage of the shiny new RDNA architecture update and a capacious 8GB of GDDR6 to deliver performance just barely ahead of Nvidia's 2060 Super, for a slightly lower price. The 5700 XT is a fantastic card if you're looking to push really high frame rates on a high refresh rate display at 1080p, or you crave a stable 60(ish) FPS at QHD. With AMD's last minute price drop (knocking the 5700 XT down to $399), it's an extremely viable alternative to Nvidia's 2060 Super. It may lack dedicated hardware (or driver) support for ray tracing, but in terms of sheer in-game performance, it edges out the 2060 Super by a narrow margin. If you're not overly concerned about DXR (or Vulcan-RT) support, or if you're squarely in the Red Team's camp, the 5700 XT is an easy recommendation—especially if you're upgrading from a card that's a couple of generations old. It's slightly below the 2060 Super on our list because of that lack of ray tracing support, but really, it's tied for fifth. EVGA GeForce GTX 1660 Super SC Ultra (Image credit: Future) 7. GeForce GTX 1660 Super 6GB The best graphics card for mainstream gaming GPU Cores: 1,280 | Base Clock: 1,530MHz | Boost Clock: 1,785MHz | GFLOPS: 5,027 | Memory: 6GB GDDR6 | Memory Clock: 14 GT/s | Memory Bandwidth: 336GB/s Good 1080p performanceBetter value than 1660 TiProven Turing architectureCrowded price pointNo RTX features The release of the GTX 1660 Super makes for the perfect middle ground between the 1660 Ti and 1660. While not as expensive as the Ti, the performance ends up overlapping the Ti in many categories. So, you end up getting a card that's great for 1080p gaming and doesn't break the bank, making it one of the best graphic cards under $300. For context, you can get over 70 fps on Borderlands 3 with medium graphical presets, which isn't too shabby. Unfortunately, you lose the newer Nvidia RTX features such as ray tracing, which is a bummer. If you're building a budget PC, ray tracing isn't as big of a deal when you just want to play games well. The 1660 Super outperforms its AMD counterparts in that same price range, again making it the perfect card if you're looking for the most bang for your buck. AMD's rumored RX 5600 XT could overtake this once it releases, depending on pricing. XFX Radeon RX 590 Fatboy (Image credit: Future) 8. AMD Radeon RX 590 The best graphics card of AMD's mid-tier GPU Cores: 2,304 | Base Clock: 1,469MHz | Boost Clock: 1,545MHz | GFLOPS: 7,120 | Memory: 8GB GDDR5 | Memory Clock: 8 GT/s | Memory Bandwidth: 256GB/s Good value and performance for 1080p8GB of VRAMUses more power than GTX 1660Same old Polaris architecture Originally a $280 graphics card, the RX 590 now routinely sells for around $200 or less. That makes a world of difference in value, and performance is still good. The GTX 1660 is roughly tied with the RX 590, at the same price, and it's a more efficient card. However, there are games where the 6GB on the Nvidia card can be a bit limiting. We rate the RX 590 just ahead of the GTX 1660 for performance, though that's splitting hairs. Depending on where you're located, AMD's new RX 5500 XT 8GB card may be a better value. Performance is basically tied, though the 5500 XT does use quite a bit less power. The RX 590 is also about 20 percent faster than the older RX 580 8GB. If you're looking at building a complete PC and not just a graphics card upgrade, we recommend faster GPUs even if they cost more. But if you're trying to keep the GPU cost under $200, RX 590 is still a good option. Just make sure you have a PSU with a the necessary 8-pin and 6-pin power connections that most 590 cards use. AMD Radeon RX 5700 (Image credit: ©AMD) 9. AMD Radeon RX 5700 The best graphics card for frames/dollar GPU Cores: 2,304 | Base Clock: 1,465MHz | Boost Clock: 1,725MHz | GFLOPS: 7,949 | Memory: 8GB GDDR6 | Memory Clock: 14 GT/s | Memory Bandwidth: 448GB/s Excellent performance at FHD and QHD medium-highUses less power than the 5700 XTGreat price for a mid-tier cardLacks ray tracing supportNo marquee feature The launch of the 5700-series of cards is a landmark moment for AMD, which has been struggling to find its footing in the graphics card market in the face of Nvidia's dominance. While its previous RX cards have been aggressively priced and allowed AMD to maintain a foothold in the budget space, the mid- and high-tier range has been all Team Green for the past generation plus. The 5700 and 5700 XT radically change that dynamic. In them, AMD has a card with the price and performance to genuinely challenge Nvidia's RTX offerings (including the new Super launch), not in small part due to the last second price cut AMD announced just before launch. At $349, with performance exceeding that of the vanilla 2060 by 10% or more, the 5700 is an excellent value even in the face of Nvidia's Super counterpunch. The three core components that make this such a massive event for AMD's lineup are the Navi 10 GPU, the brand new RDNA architecture, and the 7nm process. While the 5700-series isn't the first deployment of a 7nm GPU (after the Radeon VII and Vega 20), it's easily the most impressive, and certainly the most important for gamers. While the 5700 may lack marquee features like ray tracing or DLSS support, in terms of base performance at this price point it's currently head of the class. How we test graphics cards and performance While the CPU is still the 'brain' of your PC, dozens of games every year will push your graphics card to its limits. It's the component you'll want to upgrade most frequently, but if you buy the right card, it should last you at least two years. For gaming systems, it's also likely the most expensive part in your build. On a practical budget, it's critical to find the graphics card with the best ratio of price to performance. That's why we've previously looked at cards in the $300/£250 range, though the best values are currently either above or below that mark. RECENT GRAPHICS CARD REVIEWS Nvidia GPUs: RTX 2080 Ti RTX 2080 RTX 2070 Super RTX 2070 RTX 2060 Super RTX 2060 GTX 1660 Ti GTX 1660 Super GTX 1660 GTX 1650 AMD GPUs: Radeon VII RX 5700 XT RX 5700 RX 5500 XT 8GB RX 5500 XT 4GB RX Vega 56 and 64 RX 590 For raw performance, Nvidia's RTX 2080 Ti is a killer card, easily outperforming all older cards. It's also modestly overclockable, quiet, and reasonably efficient. But it costs an arm and a leg. You can argue about whether you really need ultra quality or what resolution to run, but your wallet will likely end up pointing you at cards in the $200-$350 range. That's why the RTX 2060 Super and RX 5700 are such impressive cards, even if they're not the fastest kids on the block. We recommend the RTX 2060 Super, RTX 2070 Super, or maybe the RX 5700 XT to most—but not all—PC gamers. They're not the only options worth considering. Performance scales with price as you move up the ladder, but near the top you get greatly diminishing returns. The same goes for moving down to the ladder, though: go too low and while the price might look good, performance could leave you wanting. So we factor in all of these elements when reviewing and recommending graphics cards. Do you need a new graphics card? If you're doubtful that your current PC is fast enough to warrant purchasing a better graphics card, I have some data for you. Even with the fastest graphics card around, running at a resolution that puts more of the burden on your CPU (1080p ultra), there's often only a minor improvement in gaming performance. Yes, truly old CPUs are going to struggle, but going from a Core i7-4770K to a Core i7-8700K only improves gaming performance by 20 percent on average, at 1080p ultra. What happens if you use a graphics card that's 20-30 percent slower than an RTX 2080? Your CPU becomes even less of a factor. If you have at least 8GB of system memory and a Core i7-4770K or better CPU, you should be fine with everything up to about the GTX 1070 Ti / RX Vega 56 level of performance. We wouldn't recommend buying an i7-4770K these days, however, so when it comes time to upgrade look at our choice for the best CPU for gaming. Don't be fooled into thinking VRAM capacity is more important than the GPU, either. It can be a factor, but slower GPUs with 4GB VRAM usually can't handle settings that actually need 4GB VRAM, and games that need 8GB will also tend to favor GPUs closer to the RTX 2080 than the RX 580. There's also very little (if any) discernible difference in most games when switching from 2GB to 4GB textures, never mind 4GB to 8GB. All the cards we've selected have at least 4GB, which is more than sufficient for high quality, and it's usually enough for ultra settings as well. Testing graphics cards Our graphics card recommendations are based on our own extensive benchmarks and testing, and then factoring in the price. We have benchmark data for the complete range of Nvidia and AMD graphics cards, including all the RTX 20-series, GTX 10-series and AMD Radeon VII, RX Vega, RX 5000 and RX 500 series. We've previously looked at the R9 Fury/300/200 series and GTX 900/700 series, but due to time constraints and availability we're no longer actively testing most of these cards. However, I've included one or two representatives from each generation as a point of reference. A WORD ABOUT SLI AND CROSSFIRE If you're looking for maximum performance, you can run two cards in SLI or CrossFire. However, it's become increasingly common for major games to completely ignore multi-GPU users. That includes all DXR games. Still, if you want two GPUs, it's an option, and these days we'd worry less about dual x16 connections (ie, X299) and more about the CPU. Our testing indicates the i9-9900K or i7-8700K generally beat out the AMD Ryzen, Threadripper, and Intel X299 CPUs for multi-GPU. Graphics performance isn't the only consideration. The quality of game drivers and other features supported by the card are important. The card's noise level, power draw, and temperature matter, too. Thankfully, nearly all modern cards are fairly quiet, even under load, and temperatures are within the acceptable range as well, though Nvidia still has an advantage when it comes to power. We test each card on a high-end PC at 1080p medium, 1080p ultra, 1440p ultra, and 4K with ultra/high settings. We take the results from fifteen games, mostly newer releases, using the 'best' API for each GPU on each game. That means low-level APIs are used for AMD cards if they're available, while DX12/Vulkan are only used in certain games for Nvidia cards. Here's how the cards stack up in terms of average and minimum frame rates across these games. You can see individual game charts including most of these GPUs in our RX 5500 XT 8GB review. [Performance charts updated as of January 3, 2020] Image 1 of 4 Graphics Card performance and pricing charts, January 2020 (Image credit: Future) Swipe left/right for additional charts Graphics Card performance and pricing charts, January 2020 (Image credit: Future) Graphics Card performance and pricing charts, January 2020 (Image credit: Future) Graphics Card performance and pricing charts, January 2020 (Image credit: Future) Nvidia claims most of the top spots for performance, with the Radeon VII and RX 5700 XT coming in below the RTX 2070 Super and GTX 1080 Ti, but above the RTX 2070. That's how far behind AMD is, unfortunately: its latest GPUs end up being a hair slower than Nvidia's nearly 3-years-old card. That's probably also a big part of why the RTX cards cost so much more than their 'equivalent' 10-series counterparts. But you don't need to buy at the top of the chart to get good performance, as mainstream cards like the RX 570/580 and GTX 1060 3GB/6GB are still totally viable, and at lower settings the GTX 970 and R9 390 still plug along nicely. They might not do so well at 1440p ultra, but they're more than capable of running most games at 1080p medium to high quality, sometimes more. But how do these cards compare in terms of value? Here's a look at fps per monetary unit, for cards that can still be purchased new at reasonable retail prices (which means we're no longer tracking Nvidia's previous generation GTX 10-series cards). [Prices for charts updated as of January 3, 2020] Image 1 of 3 Graphics Card performance and pricing charts, January 2020 (Image credit: Future) Swipe right/left for Euros/pounds Graphics Card performance and pricing charts, January 2020 (Image credit: Future) Graphics Card performance and pricing charts, January 2020 (Image credit: Future) Image 1 of 3 Graphics Card performance and pricing charts, January 2020 (Image credit: Future) Swipe right/left for Euros/pounds Graphics Card performance and pricing charts, January 2020 (Image credit: Future) Graphics Card performance and pricing charts, January 2020 (Image credit: Future) In terms of best value, we've provided two different looks at what the cards offer. The top charts show the graphics cards in isolation, which can be useful if you have a PC and you're only looking to upgrade your GPU. The bottom charts look at framerates in terms of total system cost, using a decent (about $700, not including the GPU) build as a reference point. Neither approach is a perfect, but the two give a range of how the cards rate in terms of value. The markets change the picture slightly, but the RX 5500 XT / 570 / 580 / 590 and GTX 1660 / 1650 cards are consistently at the top of the GPU charts, with the more expensive GPUs like the Radeon VII and RTX 2080 Ti / 2080 Super falling to the bottom. The RX 570 4GB and GTX 1650 Super trade places at the top spot. The problem is that while budget and midrange GPUs on their own may look good, combine it with system price, especially on a decent modern PC, and you're almost always better off putting more money into your graphics card. The RX 5700 XT / 5700 and RTX 2070 Super / 2060 Super top the charts based on current prices, while budget and mid-range GPUs occupy the bottom slots. But whichever charts you look at, keep in mind the types of games you want to play as well as your monitor, because higher resolution displays tend to need more powerful GPUs. Wrapping it up Looking forward, computer graphics is a fast-changing field. AMD released the first ever 7nm GPUs last year, but Nvidia is expected to join the 7nm club in the coming months. Our recommendations are based off performance combined with current prices, and price cuts or a limited time sale could easily move a card to the top of the list. If you find your current system isn't keeping up with the gaming times, look at the performance charts and decide how far up the ladder you're looking to climb, then buy accordingly. Those who already own an R9 390 or GTX 970 or better should still be able to run any current game, though not necessarily at 60 fps and maximum quality. Games continue to push for new levels of performance, but tuning a few settings should keep most graphics cards viable for at least a few years.+++6
Nowadays it feels like every time that I blink, when I open my eyes again there’s a new free to play collection RPG for mobile. It has become a hot genre for practically any IP you can think of over the past couple of years, but it was going on six years ago now that Com2uS struck gold with Summoners War: Sky Arena (Free), which to my recollection was one of if not the first big breakout hit for this particular type of game. It hasn’t really slowed down since then either, and Com2uS has big plans to expand the Summoners War franchise into all sorts of different media, including new games. One of those new games which they have just announced this week is a new mobile MMORPG based in the same universe called Summoners War: Chronicles. It is set 70 years before the events that take place in Summoners War: Sky Arena, and “redesigns Summoners War’s now iconic mobile gameplay into a full-fledged MMORPG with real-time combat." Here are the first gameplay screens for Summoners War: Chronicles. As for what Summoners War: Chronicles is all about, here’s the brief description from the press release: “Players can select up to three distinctive characters and enter real-time battles with up to three summoned monsters per character. Characters can share summoned monsters and resources, allowing players to make strategic choices for diversified gameplay. The gameplay images also feature multiple players attacking the boss monster by using their summoned monsters in the raid field." As I mentioned previously, Com2uS is gearing up to really expand the Summoners War universe and they’ve even gone as far as to create something called the “Summoners War Universe Bible" which lays out all the lore for the series so that each new game, or show, or comic, or whatever can fit in to the greater game universe. That will include Summoners War: Chronicles as well as another new game they announced around this time last year called Summoners War: Lost Centuria, which is a real-time strategy game that is apparently still in the works. No specific release date has been revealed for Summoners War: Chronicles but they expect to launch it in the second half of this year.+++6 We don’t often cover sales anymore because, frankly, most mobile games are free nowadays and even many of the paid games do the yo-yo pricing method of having sales so often they don’t even feel special anymore. Sometimes though there are some very excellent games that rarely have sales, and so it feels worth highlighting to tell people who don’t own said excellent game yet to grab it while it’s at a great price. Today that excellent game that is hardly ever on sale is the roguelike deck-building game Meteorfall: Journey ($1.99) from developer Slothwerks. The reason for the sale? Why, to celebrate Meteorfall’s second anniversary, of course. Which leads me to asking yet again where the heck does the time go? If you aren’t familiar with Meteorfall at all, feast your eyes on this silly and way too catchy launch trailer. From today until Sunday, Meteorfall can be had for the low price of $1.99, which is half off its regular price of $3.99. The only other times Meteorfall has been on sale was one year ago for its 1st anniversary, and one year before that as a launch discount. So yeah, this is basically your once-a-year chance to get this game on sale. But wait, there’s more! Today a brand new update has launched for Meteorfall which adds in new playable character Varfa and her 30+ brand new cards. In fact, updates are an important part of the last two years of Meteorfall, as even though we loved the original release in our review, the game has been added to tremendously over these paszst two years and it is an even greater game today than it was on launch. If you want the dirty details of every update that’s ever been released, including today’s, they have been meticulously chronicled at this link here. If you don’t care about all that and just want to play an awesome roguelike card game, then go grab Meteorfall while it’s only two bucks, or else I guess we’ll just see you again next year.+++6
History is not always kind to great games. Titles once heralded as masterworks are often lost as console cycles turn. Alternatively, there are the offbeat outliers completely shunned during their own lifetimes, only to be quietly ransacked by later generations of designers. Here, we be remember 30 brilliant, idiosyncratic, challenging or just plain weird titles that have been erased from the gaming annals, or at least criminally overlooked. Each one of these did something interesting with gaming, just not interesting enough to be endlessly recalled in misty-eyed retro articles or on otherwise pretty good Charlie Brooker documentaries. What have I forgotten? What crimes against video game nostalgia have I committed? Add your own favourites in the comments section. 3D Deathchase (Micromega, ZX Spectrum, 1983) 3D Death Chase Written by lone coder Mervyn Estcourt (who also produced a PC remake almost 20 years later), this remarkably progressive 3D chase game gets the player to ride a futuristic motorbike through dense woodland, attempting to track down and shoot enemy riders. The first-person view and smooth sensation of movement were astonishing at the time (especially considering it ran on the older 16k Spectrum), and it no doubt prepared the way for future variations on the free-roaming driving game. Aliens: The Computer Game (Software Studios/Electric Dreams Software, C64/Spectrum, 1986) Aliens Activision developed a higher profile tie-in with the movie, but this version is far superior and has lasting significance in game design terms. It's essentially a prototype first-person shooter, complete with moveable targeting reticule. Players have to guide six of the film's characters through the colony base, toward the queen's lair. Although movement is essentially limited to left and right (firing at doors lets you pass through them), the action is tense, and the importance of quick accurate aiming hints at the FPS genre to come. There's also a brilliantly unsettling take on the movie's motion tracker sound effect that ramps up the scare factor considerably. And when the face huggers leap at you it is terrifying. Alter Ego (Activision, C64/PC/Apple II, 1986) Alter Ego Designed by psychologist Peter Favaro and released by Activision, this fascinating life simulation gave players control over either a male of female character as they progressed from childhood to grave. Designed around a series of key decision points, the mostly text-led experience was based on hundreds of interviews conducted by Favaro, and was hugely critically acclaimed at the time. Alongside David Crane's Little Computer People it laid the groundwork for modern era "virtual soap opera" The Sims. Alas, the sparse presentation and offbeat concept meant that the sim sold poorly and a proposed sequel, based around rearing a child, was scrapped. You can play the original game online. Astal (Sega, Sega Saturn, 1995) Astal Golden Axe, Streets of Rage, Altered Beast... Plenty of Sega's classic side-scrolling beat-'em-ups have gone on to become legends of the genre. But somehow this beautiful early Saturn release has been over-looked, perhaps thanks to the console's untimely demise. Banished from Earth by an angry goddess, the eponymous hero must return to rescue the girl he loves. Okay, forget the horribly trite story and revel in the gorgeous hand-drawn artwork and interesting attacks, which allow Astal to blow his enemies over or wrench trees out of the ground to chuck at them. There's also an innovative but tricky co-op mode which puts player two into the role of Astal's bird sidekick. Watch this playthrough for a taste of the wonderful character and landscape designs. Bioforge (EA/Origin, PC, 1995) BioForge The "interactive movie" genre of the mid-90s brought us plenty of nightmarishly unplayable dross as game developers fell in love with the idea of using full-motion-video to create, ugh, "cinematic" experiences. But there were some fascinating examples, too, like this cyberpunk adventure, set on a moon base governed by religious maniacs who believe man must evolve toward a machine-hybrid state. The player awakens as a cyborg and must escape the lab, piecing together the plot from PDA diary entries and using security and computer equipment to hack defenses. Elements of Deus Ex, Bioshock and Dead Space all combined to create a tense and interesting adventure. It was so expensive to produce, however, that low sales ensured a planned sequel never arrived. Edge later published an excellent 'Making of' feature. Bust A Groove (Enix/Metro Graphics, PlayStation, 1998) Bust A Groove This formative rhythm action game cordially invites players to bust ridiculous disco moves by following onscreen direction prompts, in a similar manner to Sony's revered PaRappa The Rapper. The difference here is the head-to-head competitive dance fighting element, allowing dancers to knock each other off the beat with special disco fight moves. Featuring an excellent electronica soundtrack, bizarre characters and super-smooth animation, the title helped build the "post-pub gaming" credentials of the PlayStation, and spawned a sequel. But then Konami's all-conquering Dance Dance Revolution strutted in and kicked it from the dance floor. ChuChu Rocket (Sega/Sonic Team, Dreamcast, 1999) ChuChu Rocket How this frenetic combination of Pac Man, Bomberman, Lemmings and Hungry Hippos failed to become a continually updated gaming staple is beyond us. Designed by Sonic co-creator Yuji Naka it's a fast-paced maze puzzler in which players have to place arrows on the floor to direct a line of mice into rockets so they can escape the giant cats. In the four-player mode, participants can also use arrows to direct the feline enemies toward competitors, making for fraught, hugely tense encounters. Given away free to European Dreamcast owners, the game would later surface on GameBoy Advance and iPhone but should – if there were a whiff of justice in the universe – be on every single console released from 1999 to the end of time. Devil Dice (Sony/Shift, PlayStation, 1998) Devil Dice A modest success on its release and followed by two sequels, this ingenious puzzler was briefly revered, but has somehow slipped from wider memory. Players must navigate a grid by stepping on and turning dice cubes – when the numbers match between two adjacent cubes, they disappear. It's sort of a numerical match-three puzzle, bringing in some of the deeper mathematical reasoning of Area/Code's masterful iPhone title Drop 7. Originally created using Sony's home programmable console, the Net Yaroze, it was one of the few 'homebrew' titles to see release on the PlayStation. Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem (Nntendo/Silicon Knights, GameCube, 2002) Eternal Darkness Resident Evil 4 wasn't the only standout survival horror experience on Nintendo's under-rated GameCube system. Developed by Canadian studio Silicon Knights and originally meant for the N64, Eternal Darkness is a fascinating Lovecraftian romp following student Alexandria Roivas as she investigates a book known as the Tome of Eternal Darkness. The powerful artifact provides a portal to a selection of previous lives, all of which must be experienced by the player in order to prevent an ancient evil from re-surfacing. The narrative and locations are creepy and unsettling, but the best part is the sanity meter which drops when you encounter enemies, causing visual disturbances and even tricking you into believing your TV has broken. Critically acclaimed, but with its mature rating, Nintendo fans weren't quite sure what to make of it. A proposed sequel never materialised, despite Nintendo renewing the trademark as recently as 2012. Meanwhile, many of the original development team went on to form Precursor Games and planned a spiritual successor named Shadow of the Eternals which sadly failed to hit its crowdfunding target last year. Freedom Fighters (EA/IO Interactive, GameCube/PS2/Xbox, 2003) Freedom Fighters On a break from the highly successful Hitman series, Danish studio IO Interactive launched this innovative third-person squad-based shooter, getting to the whole America-invaded-by-Communists plotline years before Call of Duty. You play as a regular Joe running round New York taking on Russian troops – and the more you kill, the more your "Charisma rating" goes up allowing you to recruit followers. That's right, it's Homefront meets Twitter. Great controls and smooth squad commands ensured a thrilling yet surprisingly tactical experience. Maddeningly, it seems a proposed sequel was put on indefinite hold so that the studio could work on... Kane & Lynch. Wha... why?!! Anyway, Eurogamer has a nice retrospective on the game right here. FreQuency (Sony, PS2, 2001) FreQuency The first title from music game innovator Harmonix was a compelling cross between Tempest and Rez. Your avatar, FreQ, zooms down an octagonal tunnel, swapping walls to hit the correct musical chunks and keep the soundtrack pumping. Fans of the musical game genre recall this trailblazer fondly, but it doesn't get enough credit for its crucial interface innovations. Famously, then VP of Xbox, Ed Fries, turned the game down, but suggested the team work on a similar idea with a dedicated controller. They went away and made Guitar hero. Gitaroo Man (Koei/Inis, PS2/PSP, 2001) Gitaroo Man Of the many rhythm action games involving talking dogs and heroes that transform from lonely schoolboys into guitar-wielding galactic saviours, Gitaroo Man is definitely in the top three. Developed by music game specialist Inis (which would go on to create the Xbox karaoke title, Lips) it's a deranged mash up of teen manga, weird future rock and beat-'em-up complexity. PaRappa got there first and is the more approachable of the two, but Gitaroo Man is a joyous celebration of music, fashion and surreality. A later PSP version added new modes and was well-received, but the title has never escaped its 'cult' label. Hellfire (Toaplan, arcade/Mega Drive/PC Engine, 1989) Hellfire Okay so the late eighties and early nineties saw no shortage of beautiful scrolling shooters, but when the subject comes up, it's the works of Irem, SNK and Treasure that tend to get eulogised. The now sadly defunct developer Toaplan was a master of the genre though, and Hellfire is a scorching space blaster with a wonderfully balanced and satisfying weapon system that lets you quickly swap between four different laser types to take on the various attack waves. The Mega Drive conversion is arguably better than the arcade original, adding a super cannon and new difficulty levels, and it remains one of the console's finest moments. Incidentally, Toaplan followed Hellfire with another side-scroller, Zero Wing, which, in its European Mega Drive conversion, contains the immortal line, "All your base are belong to us". Herzog Zwei (Sega/Technosoft, Mega Drive, 1989) Herzon Zwei When gamers talk about the origins of the real-time strategy genre they often pick out Dune II as a starting point, forgetting the whole host of foundational games that proceeded it. One of them was Herzog Zwei, an early Mega Drive title in which the player pilots a transforming mech over a series of eight warzones, dropping units off to engage enemy craft, then issuing an array of orders. Although the AI isn't amazing, the array of available vehicles, including both air and ground options, made this a surprisingly sophisticated tactical challenge on a machine better known at the time for brawlers and shooters. The head-to-head mode was a fantastic inclusion, too – but even this wasn't enough to impress contemporary critics, many of whom were bemused by the comparatively glacial pace of battle. Interstate 76 (Activision, PC, 1997) Interstate 76 Released in the midst of a major seventies revival, Activision's stylish driving adventure was a spot-on pastiche of that era's cop shows, road movies and paranoid thrillers. Set in an alternative America where the 1973 oil crisis has never been resolved, it follows unlikely heroes Groove Champion and Taurus as they go up against a Mad Max-style army of muscle car psychos. The brash flat-shaded visuals and funk jam soundtrack accentuate the exploitation feel, and there is some brilliantly dark humour hiding behind more conventional period references. There was a sequel, Interstate 82, and a spin-off series of car combat games, Vigilante 8, on consoles, but, come on Activision, a proper remake would go down amazingly well on Steam. Little Big Adventure (EA, PC/PlayStation, 1994) Little Big Adventure The early-to-mid-nineties saw a burst of creativity in the French development scene with titles like Alone in the Dark, Flashback and Rayman attracting worldwide acclaim. Among these idiosyncratic gems was Little Big Adventure, a colourful science fiction epic developed by Adeline Software, and overseen by Frédérick Raynal, the co-creator of the Alone in the Dark series. The surreal narrative follows unwilling prophet Twinsen as he journeys across his world to defeat evil overlord, Dr. Funfrock. The appeal is in the disarmingly neat isometric visuals and strange puzzles and side-stories, and the game sold well enough to spawn a decent sequel. There has been talk of a remake, but the title's quirky charms are unknown to many younger adventure fans. Meridian 59 (The 3DO Company, PC, 1995) Meridian 59 While the ill-fated 3DO company is best known for its failed 32bit games console, it was also the publisher for this seminal massively multiplayer online RPG. Originally coded by brothers Andrew and Chris Kirmse in their parent's basement, the game arrived before Everquest and Ultima Online, bringing 3D visuals to the online adventure genre and introducing a large fanbase to many of the key conventions that would follow. After 3DO abandoned the title in 2000, the game was taken on by Near Death Studios, which itself closed in 2010. But somehow it has survived and is now run as a free-to-play open source project by the Kirmse brothers. A living piece of MMORPG history. Mischief Makers (Nintendo/Treasure, N64, 1997) Mischief Makers Named Yuke Yuke!! Trouble Makers in Japan, this delightfully colourful and energetic puzzle scroller from Treasure pits ultra intergalactic cybot Marina against the evil Clancer empire as she fights to rescue her imprisoned employer. Created by many of the team behind the legendary Gunstar Heroes, it has a gorgeous kawaii styling and an interesting attack mechanic that allows Marina to grab and shake enemies. With its offbeat level design (Marina has to compete in an athletics event in one mission) and decent boss battles, Mischief Makers achieved cult appeal at the time, but because it could be finished reasonably quickly, reviews were muted. Some kind of Wii U/3DS update or at least a Virtual Console port would be extremely welcome. Nato Commander (Microprose, Apple II/Atari/C64, 1983) Nato Commander The first military strategy sim designed by Civilization creator Sid Meier is recalled by fans of the genre, of course, but often overlooked in retrospectives of the famed game designer. Set during the Cold War, the player is tasked with moving allied forces against Russia and its Warsaw Pact brethren as nuclear war threatens in the background. Like the later, and incredibly chilling Theater Europe, it captures the paranoia of the era, but Nato Commander also brings in political elements such as strikes in munitions factories or friendly nations inconveniently surrendering mid-offensive. The Neverhood (Neverhood, Inc/Dreamworks, PC/PlayStation, 1996) The NeverHood Designed by Earthworm Jim artist Doug TenNapel, this unusual claymation-based point-and-click adventure stars an amnesiac figure, Klaymen, who wakes up on a deserted world and must discover what the heck has happened. The animation is beautiful, the slowly unfolding narrative intriguing, and there's a great soundtrack by cult American songwriter Terry Scott Taylor. It was admired at the time, but nostalgic recollections of nineties adventures are now largely dominated by the great LucasArts titles, leaving The Neverhood skulking in their immense shadows. There was a sequel, Skullmonkeys, and last year TenNapel ran a successful Kickstarter to fund a spiritual successor, Armikrog – although the right-wing views he has espoused on Republican opinion site, Brietbart, have caused controversy. Oids (FTL Games, Atari ST/Mac, 1987) Oids Over-shadowed in its day by the mighty Commodore Amiga, the Atari ST computer had few of its own original titles to shout about. One of them, however, was this inertia-based shooter, which borrowed elements from sub-genre heavyweights Gravitar and Choplifter as well as Defender to tense and exciting effect. The aim is to navigate a series of minimalist caverns in your dart-like craft, taking out enemies and rescuing robotic hostages – the eponymous Oids. A key appeal of the game is its taut fuel system: you need the stuff both to fly and to recharge your shields, so there's a constant balance going on as it slowly runs down. FTL, of course, would later become much better known for its hugely innovative and influential first-person RPG, Dungeon Master. Oni (Rockstar/Bungie, Mac/PC/PS3, 2001) Oni In between revolutionising the first-person shooter genre with Marathon (1994) and Halo (2001), Bungie took some time out to update the third-person beat-em-'up with this cyberpunk action romp. Heroine Konoko stands alongside D'arci Stern from Urban Chaos as one of the great lost female protagonists of video gaming – a renegade cop with a devastating range of combat moves, an interesting back story and clothes that... well, she basically wore actual clothes (a situation that artist Lorraine McLees claims had to be continually fought for). Although criticised at the time for its sparse visuals and lack of multiplayer, this combination shooter/brawler has such pace and energy, paving the way for modern melee adventures like Batman: Arkham Asylum. Pyjamarama (Mikrogen, Amstrad/C64/Sectrum, 1984) Pyjamarama Everyone of a certain age recalls Britsoft favourites like Jet Set Willy, Skool Daze and Attack of the Mutant Camels, but many of the more nuanced classics are slipping from collective memory. Created by lone coder Chris Hinsley, Pyjamarama is a platforming adventure, starring loveable everyman Wally Week who has forgotten to set his alarm clock, and must now wander the house in a somnambulist state, looking for the key to wind it up. Like Jet Set Willy, it is filled with surreal puzzles and weird enemies, but in its detailed depiction of Wally's modest terrace home, it reveals one of the charms of early-eighties British games: they weren't always about space heroes or ludicrous anthropomorphised critters; they were sometimes about normal people worrying about everyday things. Wally is so distraught about the possibility of losing his job at the car factory, he sleep walks his way to a solution. Like the Monty Mole series, which made satirical references to the miners' strike, it says things about the country at that time. A social history in blocky sprites. Return Fire (Silent Software/Prolific, 3DO/PC/PlayStation, 1995) Return Fire True, the 3DO console was not a great success when it was launched as a hugely over-priced multimedia machine in 1993. And while its software library was let's say modestly populated, it boasted a few minor masterpieces. One was this excellent two-player military sim, in which participants use their tanks, helicopters and jeeps to invade the opponent's base and capture their flag. It's sort of a cross between Advance Wars and Counter Strike, a mix of fraught action and sneaky thinking, and if it had been originally released on PC and PlayStation rather than ported over later, we'd probably still be playing sequels. Runabout (ASCII/Climax Entertainment, PlayStation, 1997) Runaround Western developers don't entirely own the open-world adventure genre. Although Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row are dominant, Japanese studios have pitched in: Sega with its brilliant Crazy Taxi and Emergency Call Ambulance titles, and Climax Entertainment with its chaotic Runabout series. Designed by Climax director Kan Naito (also responsible for the classic Shining and Landstalker RPGs), its a mission-based driving quest, in which points are earned by smashing up as much scenery and as many other road users as possible. Renamed Felony 11-79 in the West and followed by a series of inferior sequels, it is as daft, hilarious and anarchic as you'd expect from a game that rewards you for driving a bus through a cafe. Sacrifice (Shiny/Avalon, PC, 2000) Sacrifice Visually stunning and filled with interesting stylistic flourishes, Shiny Entertainment's real-time strategy sim pitches warring wizards against each other in an exotic fantasy landscape. With an emphasis on close combat rather than resource macro-management, the title was at odds with genre big-hitters like Command and Conquer and Total Annihilation. But it brought in its own packed menagerie of beasts, spells and weapons and the third-person action made the warring more immediate and exciting. Although critically revered, it sold poorly and is barely credited for its technical innovations – as Kieron Gillen later lamented in his retrospective essay on the game. Tenchu: Stealth Assassins (Acquire/Activision, PlayStation, 1998) Tenchu Although the PlayStation One era of fighting games was dominated by the showy Tekken series, there were a few more sophisticated outliers. Acquire's ninja stealth adventure, for example, is just about the most unforgiving combat game of the era. Players are slung into the bloody world of Feudal Japan with just a blade and a series of mission objectives. As with the Thief series, quietly sneaking about in the shadows and surprising enemies is the only way, because face-to-face fights can be ended with just one swipe of your opponent's sword. Dark, complex and dripping in atmosphere, Tenchu was a sophisticated cult classic. A series of sequels followed but we haven't seen a new one in five years. It would come into its own on the PS4 or Xbox One. Vib-Ribbon (Sony/NanaOn-Sha, PlayStation, 1999) Vib-Ribbon More of an audio/visual experiment than a game, this monochrome rhythm action folly from the makers of PaRappa the Rappa involves guiding Vibri the rabbit along an ever-pulsating ribbon, avoiding pits and carefully managing looped sections. Naturally, the landscape changes in time to the music, but the key feature is that players are able to play their own CDs with the onscreen world reacting accordingly. Much fun could be had attempting the game with musical extremes, either speed metal or ambient house, and the concept was clever enough to get the game into Moma's design collection. Vin-Ribbon's eccentric creator, Masaya Matsuura, has often spoken about a modern update – with Sony now actively pursuing offbeat PS4 projects like Hohokum, it could be his time. The Warriors (Rockstar, PS2/Xbox, 2005) The Warriors No one in the games industry does sleazy urban grit like Rockstar and this tie-in with the cult 1979 movie is one of the company's most under-rated titles. Following the events of the movie, players control the eponymous street gang is it makes its way through New York City to its Coney Island home base. Unlike the Grand Theft Auto titles, there's little in the way of open-world freedom, but this is more of a straightforward brawler, with a complex fighting mechanic and rollicking two-player co-op mode. Typically for Rockstar there is also an amazing licensed soundtrack slinging in '70s disco hits to contrast the relentless violence; the company even brought back original cast members to voice their virtual representations. According to Kotaku, a spiritual success was planned, based around the mods vs rockers battles of '60s Britain, but sadly nothing emerged. Zillion (Sega/Tatsunoko Production, Master System, 1987) Zillion Though successful in Europe, Sega's 8bit Master System console nose-dived in Japan and the US so this tough, multi-directional platformer has faded from memory. Which is criminal because it is a tense, sprawling combination of Metroid and Impossible Mission, pitching the player into a maze-like enemy base looking for crucial diskettes filled with valuable information. Interestingly, every door in this place is locked so you have to explore each room, looking for code combinations to make progress. There are cool little RPG elements too. As you rush through you can power-up the character's health, jump and laser gun, and if you discover his two team mates, Apple and Champ, you can switch between them, making use of their differing capabilities. It's an unforgiving adventure, but totally worth revisiting if you can track down a working Master System and a copy of the game on eBay. And in the unlikely event you beat it, there's a sequel out there too. • Tech Weekly Podcast: What will computer games look like in 2014? America faces an epic choice... ... in the coming year, and the results will define the country for a generation. These are perilous times. Over the last three years, much of what the Guardian holds dear has been threatened – democracy, civility, truth. This US administration is establishing new norms of behaviour. Anger and cruelty disfigure public discourse and lying is commonplace. Truth is being chased away. But with your help we can continue to put it center stage. Rampant disinformation, partisan news sources and social media's tsunami of fake news is no basis on which to inform the American public in 2020. The need for a robust, independent press has never been greater, and with your support we can continue to provide fact-based reporting that offers public scrutiny and oversight. Our journalism is free and open for all, but it's made possible thanks to the support we receive from readers like you across America in all 50 states. "America is at a tipping point, finely balanced between truth and lies, hope and hate, civility and nastiness. Many vital aspects of American public life are in play – the Supreme Court, abortion rights, climate policy, wealth inequality, Big Tech and much more. The stakes could hardly be higher. As that choice nears, the Guardian, as it has done for 200 years, and with your continued support, will continue to argue for the values we hold dear – facts, science, diversity, equality and fairness." – US editor, John Mulholland On the occasion of its 100th birthday in 1921 the editor of the Guardian said, "Perhaps the chief virtue of a newspaper is its independence. It should have a soul of its own." That is more true than ever.

It's the second instalment in our look at games that perhaps don't invoke as much warmhearted nostalgia as they really ought to. Some of these were huge at the time, but have since been overlooked, other managed to slip completely under the radar. Many of these will be familiar to veteran gamers, though, so if you can think of some even more obscure classics, please add them in the comments section. FreQuency (Sony, PS2, 2001) FreQuency The first title from music game innovator Harmonix was a compelling cross between Tempest and Rez. Your avatar, FreQ, zooms down an octagonal tunnel, swapping walls to hit the correct musical chunks and keep the soundtrack pumping. Fans of the musical game genre recall this trailblazer fondly, but it doesn't get enough credit for its crucial interface innovations. Famously, then VP of Xbox, Ed Fries, turned the game down, but suggested the team work on a similar idea with a dedicated controller. They went away and made Guitar hero. Gitaroo Man (Koei/Ini, PS2/PSP, 2001) Gitaroo Man Of the many rhythm action games involving talking dogs and heroes that transform from lonely schoolboys into guitar-wielding galactic saviours, Gitaroo Man is definitely in the top three. Developed by music game specialist Inis (which would go on to create the Xbox karaoke title, Lips) it's a deranged mash up of teen manga, weird future rock and beat-'em-up complexity. PaRappa got their first and is the more approachable of the two, but Gitaroo Man is a joyous celebration of music, fashion and surreality. A later PSP version added new modes and was well-received, but the title has never escaped its 'cult' label. Hellfire (Toaplan, arcade/Mega Drive/PC Engine, 1989) Hellfire Okay so the late eighties and early nineties saw no shortage of beautiful scrolling shooters, but when the subject comes up, it's the works of Irem, SNK and Treasure that tend to get eulogised. The now sadly defunct developer Toaplan was a master of the genre though, and Hellfire is a scorching space blaster with a wonderfully balanced and satisfying weapon system that lets you quickly swap between four different laser types to take on the various attack waves. The Mega Drive conversion is arguably better than the arcade original, adding a super cannon and new difficulty levels, and it remains one of the console's finest moments. Incidentally, Toaplan followed Hellfire with another side-scroller, Zero Wing, which, in its European Mega Drive conversion, contains the immortal line, "All your base are belong to us". Interstate 76 (Activision, PC, 1997) Interstate 76 Released in the midst of a major seventies revival, Activision's stylish driving adventure was a spot-on pastiche of that era's cop shows, road movies and paranoid thrillers. Set in an alternative America where the 1973 oil crisis has never been resolved, it follows unlikely heroes Groove Champion and Taurus as they go up against a Mad Max-style army of muscle car psychos. The brash flat-shaded visuals and funk jam soundtrack accentuate the exploitation feel, and there is some brilliantly dark humour hiding behind more conventional period references. There was a sequel, Interstate 82, and a spin-off series of car combat games, Vigilante 8, on consoles, but it seems like a proper remake would go down well on Steam. Little Big Adventure (EA, PC/PlayStation, 1994) Little Big Adventure The early-to-mid-nineties saw a burst of creativity in the French development scene with titles like Alone in the Dark, Flashback and Rayman attracting worldwide acclaim. Among these idiosyncratic gems was Little Big Adventure, a colourful science fiction epic developed by Adeline Software, and overseen by Frédérick Raynal, the co-creator of the Alone in the Dark series. The surreal narrative follows unwilling prophet Twinsen as he journeys across his world to defeat evil overlord, Dr. Funfrock. The appeal is in the disarmingly neat isometric visuals and strange puzzles and side-stories, and the game sold well enough to spawn a decent sequel. There has been talk of a remake, but the title's quirky charms are unknown to many younger adventure fans. Meridian 59 (The 3DO Company, PC, 1995) Meridian 59 While the ill-fated 3DO company is best known for its failed 32bit games console, it was also the publisher for this seminal massively multiplayer online RPG. Originally coded by brothers Andrew and Chris Kirmse in their parent's basement, the game arrived before Everquest and Ultima Online, bringing 3D visuals to the online adventure genre and introducing a large fanbase to many of the key conventions that would follow. After 3DO abandoned the title in 2000, the game was taken on by Near Death Studios, which itself closed in 2010. But somehow it has survived and is now run as a free-to-play open source project by the Kirmse brothers. A living piece of MMORPG history. Mischief Makers (Nintendo/Treasure, N64, 1997) Mischief Makers Named Yuke Yuke!! Trouble Makers in Japan, this delightfully colourful and energetic puzzle scroller from Treasure pits ultra intergalactic cybot Marina against the evil Clancer empire as she fights to rescue her imprisoned employer. Created by many of the team behind the legendary Gunstar Heroes, it has a gorgeous kawaii styling and an interesting attack mechanic that allows Marine to grab and shake enemies. With its offbeat level design (Marina has to compete in an athletics event in one mission) and decent boss battles, Mischief Makers achieved cult appeal at the time, but because it could be finished reasonably quickly, reviews were muted. Some kind of Wii U/3DS update or at least a Virtual Console port would be extremely welcome. Nato Commander (Microprose, Apple II/Atari/C64, 1983) Nato Commander The first military strategy sim designed by Civilization creator Sid Meier is recalled by fans of the genre, of course, but often overlooked in retrospectives of the famed game designer. Set during the Cold War, the player is tasked with moving allied forces against Russia and its Warsaw Pact brethren as nuclear war threatens in the background. Like the later, and incredibly chilling Theater Europe, it captures the paranoia of the era, but Nato Commander also brings in political elements such as strikes in munitions factories or friendly nations inconveniently surrendering mid-offensive. The Neverhood (Neverhood, Inc/Dreamworks, PC/PlayStation, 1996) The NeverHood Designed by Earthworm Jim artist Doug TenNapel, this is an unusual claymation-based point-and-click adventure starred an amnesiac figure, Klaymen, who wakes up on a deserted world and must discover what has happened. The animation is beautiful, the slowly unfolding narrative intriguing, and there's a great soundtrack by cult American songwriter Terry Scott Taylor. It was admired at the time, but nostalgic recollections of nineties adventures are now largely dominated by the great LucasArts adventures so The Neverhood is often overlooked. There was a sequel, Skullmonkeys, and last year TenNapel ran a successful Kickstarter to fund a spiritual successor, Armikrog – although the right-wing views he has espoused on Republican opinion site, Brietbart, have caused controversy. Oids (FTL Games, Atari ST/Mac, 1987) Oids Over-shadowed in its day by the mighty Commodore Amiga, the Atari ST computer had few of its own original titles to shout about. One of them, however, was this inertia-based shooter, which borrowed elements from sub-genre heavyweights Gravitar and Choplifter as well as Defender to tense and exciting effect. The aim is to navigate a series of minimalist caverns in your dart-like craft, taking out enemies and rescuing robotic hostages – the eponymous Oids. A key appeal of the game is its taut fuel system: you need the stuff both to fly and to recharge your shields, so there's a constant balance going on as it slowly runs down. FTL, of course, would later become much better known for its hugely innovative and influential first-person RPG, Dungeon Master.+++6
This vast space-exploration game has 1 million players – despite its unfinished state. How did a tiny team manage it? And what is a poop monster? Mary Hamilton @newsmary Mon 20 Jan 2014 06.39 ESTLast modified on Tue 12 Dec 2017 05.35 EST Shares 54 Comments 19 Starbound Starbound – the intricate, procedurally generated landscapes offer a wealth of surprises to intrepid adventurers The most important thing you should know about Starbound is that you can play the trumpet. At no point will this come in handy. In this procedurally generated universe of technocratic apes, evil sentient flowers and obscure and concerning monsters of many varieties, not once will the trumpet assist you in solving your problems. You can’t use it as a weapon (though there are plenty of those to be found). You can’t eat it or use it to keep warm (though you can plant a farm and warm yourself at a campfire). It is an absolutely useless trumpet. But you can team up with your friends and use it to take part in a harmonic rendition of Daft Punk’s Get Lucky, and that’s why it matters so much. At first glance Starbound, which sold its millionth copy a couple of weeks ago despite only being available in early beta form, is all about striking out into a strange and almost unwaveringly hostile universe. Starting out with just a ship, a matter manipulator that gathers resources painfully slowly, and a vague sense of optimism, you’re given a small starting planet within a small solar system in an impossibly vast universe. Aliens with cattle prods The worlds are persistent but randomised, each one distinct and fascinating. You might find a lush green forest world full of trees with eyes, or a desert world where bird-people stand guard over a mausoleum. You might find dungeons - deep underground structures full of angry floral people with cattle prods or apes with laser guns - or villages, full of similar characters but much, much less angry. You might just find a calm spot to do a bit of mining, and only later discover strange caverns of flesh deep, deep underground. But it’s more than a game of exploration and discovery. It’s more even than a game of survival on unforgiving worlds. Like Minecraft, it’s at its most enjoyable when you can do these things with your friends, and make stories together. It’s about killing all the robots, converting their vaults into a multi-level farm, and throwing a feast for everyone who shows up. And playing the trumpet, of course. Starbound FacebookTwitterPinterest Each planet offers a lush landscape to explore Photograph: /PR Starbound owes a great deal to a few enormous, procedural games that have preceded it, particularly Terraria and Minecraft. And it’s proud to wear its influences on its sleeve. Community manager Molly Carroll says the comparisons are probably inevitable. “People will always draw similarities - it’s this in space or it’s that in 2D - when anything new comes out. But actually it’s becoming more of a genre. It’s not about games copying each other, but building on each other.” Developer Bart van der Werf agrees. “I hope we would be seen as helping to define the tropes of this new genre.” Starbound is certainly something new. It’s dizzying in its details already, to the point where simply attempting to list all the systems in the game would make this article read like a wiki entry. Along with the instrument system, there’s the hunger system, the farming and cooking abilities, and the way you get cold at night and extremely cold on moons. There’s a raft of survival mechanics layered on top of increasingly complex mining, crafting and building systems, and that’s before you get started on the procedurally generated monsters. Lists and quests It is an incredibly ambitious project, especially for a small team like Chucklefish, and that’s nowhere more evident than in lead developer Tiy Brice’s post last month about what the future holds for the game. From underground secrets to space combat, there’s a vast vision in that list, which is only just beginning to be realised: a huge playground, an enormous world to discover and for players to impose their own ideas upon. The main quests, for the moment, act as incentives to explore and create certain items, and as gating mechanics, preventing you from crafting better arms and armour or from accessing harder areas of the universe until you’ve beaten particular monsters. But here too there are more ambitious plans: side quests, further elements to the main story, and a world that has to remain consistent and coherent despite its random generation and the fact that players individually will only see a small portion of what’s there. “The largest challenge has been integrating storyline with the procedural mechanics,” says van der Werf. “We try to place things that join up with each other in the world, so that as developers you control the story and you can have a coherent whole no matter which part of it your players see. Dungeons, for instance, are made out of set blocks that fit together, so you can still control the story and keep that coherent whole. It’s a mix between full random generation and a more structured approach.” Getting wired There are a lot of delightful details - like the trumpet - that started out as side projects, not part of the main plan, and were included because the whole team loved them. Some are individual items, others big mechanics like the wiring system, which is currently not fully implemented, but which has already been used by players to make a digital clock and a calculator, among other things. “I’m really proud of how the sand works,” says van der Werf. “It cascades down - it’s an old school mechanic that I haven’t seen in many games. If you hit the wrong stone on a desert planet you can collapse a whole planet of sand on top of your head and I really like that. We have been in permanent grind for a while, so taking time out to do a side project like that is a bit like taking a vacation.” Starbound FacebookTwitterPinterest The cute 2D graphics have shades of popular building and exploration title, Terraria That permanent grind was necessary, van der Werf says, because of the pressures of getting the game into a playable state before Christmas. Although the development process ran badly over schedule, he says, the team didn’t scale down their ambitions for what Starbound should be. But they say they had to launch something in beta after seeing how eager their community was to play something - even if it wasn’t “finished”. “We went for early access because we needed to launch. That was a lot of stress that didn’t have to be there, but it was an important deadline,” he says. “It’s definitely a better game for it. We are further along than we would have been otherwise. But we would have far fewer grey hairs if we had done it another way.” "When you’re working on a game for that long it’s easy to get tunnel vision, easy to forget what the most important things to work on really are,” says Carroll. “I think early access gets you away from that and into doing what matters most for your players.” State of play Starbound in its current state isn’t unplayable, but there are still some rough edges - systems not implemented, limited quest lines - as well as a fair few bugs and crashes, and releasing it into the wild seems to have focussed Chucklefish on the things that matter most to their community. “We’re sticking to our original plan but if something isn’t working it’s not working,” says Carroll. The community was so eager to get their hands on Starbound, and so engaged with what they were doing behind the scenes, that right from launch day the development team found that there were people working on mods for the game. Now there are more than 700 mods, ranging from cosmetic item sets to new races and technologies to the excellent ability to upgrade your ship. A few ideas from mods have already made it into the game itself. “We hoped that would happen - we didn’t expect it, but we hoped,” says van der Werf. “That amount of it has really blown us away. We started out that way because we like Minecraft, and we think a lot of its community and its longevity is built on mods. From the start we have talked to the community, and that’s shaped the way we’ve done things. Some people want complicated rewrites of the game, like changing the whole thing to a 3D perspective. They’ve asked for some simple things and some things that just aren’t really possible. Things like ‘what if every character was able to walk on four legs’, which isn’t going to happen. But a lot is possible, a lot more than you’d think. I want to work with modders to take the game in hundreds of different directions. I’m excited about the potential that’s there to make whole new games and the technology challenges there too.” Wiped out Not everything has gone off without a hitch, and Starbound still has a sense of being slightly precarious. Early after release, there were several updates which required character and world wipes. I was one of those startled to realise my first character - DJ Beep, an intrepid robot with a small farm made from chunks of obsidian I found down a particularly deep hole - had disappeared after an early change. In response to some of the feedback, the devs have prioritised a system to minimise wipes, which might be implemented in the next update (along with a big, final character and ship wipe, and more hats). Although it’s sometimes possible to play pre-update characters, the changes to balance, physics, birds, weather, wires, quests and everything else mean that it’s easy to get left behind. In some ways, that adds to the sense of exploration - every time I start up the game after an update, I’m finding more new additions to an already enormous world. I’ve played the early exploration game on half a dozen different updates, in the process discovering not only new planets, but also new mechanics. And if I don’t want to replay the early game again, other players have (of course) built a mod that lets me skip through the first few levels. “The character wipes gave a lot of anxiety in the community,” says van der Werf. “We can say ‘beta’ all we want but people still expect a finished game.” The implementation of destructive meteor storms also caused some problems, with creative builders upset to discover they had landed on planets where their creations could be at risk from the weather. But on the whole, the biggest controversies have been relatively small, and the devs don’t feel the need to change everything in response to their players. “We were adding sewer dungeons to the game and we put in a monster that people didn’t really like,” says Carroll. “There’s a monster made of poop. People expected more mature humour and lore from us, I guess. They didn’t expect a poop monster. They really didn’t like the poop monster."And the team's response? “We made another, bigger poop monster,” says Carroll. Van der Werf adds: “There’s always going to be complaints about something.” • Starbound is currently available on Steam and runs on PC, Mac and Linux. Chucklefish is planning to support other platforms, including PlayStation 4.+++6
Previously on...Your Childhood Playing through Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is very much like experiencing a re-watch of Dragon Ball Z itself. There's filler, excitement, and everything in-between. In the end, it managed to just win me over, but only because I already had an affinity with the source material. For everyone else, this anime game probably isn't going to convert you. Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review - Destructoid Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot (PC, PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One] Developer: CyberConnect2 Publisher: Bandai Namco Released: January 17, 2020 MSRP: $59.99 As I mentioned in my review in progress of the opening hours of Kakarot, there's two major elements at play in this uncharacteristic solo campaign-based affair: pure action (which is what Bandai Namco is normally all about) and exploration. That latter bit is peppered with RPG elements, many of which are complete fluff or ultimately pointless. There's some padding afoot in Kakarot, in part to extend the length of the game to the roughly 40-hour mark. If you love this universe and hanging out in it, you're probably going to be able to hand-wave some of the more menial aspects of the RPG influence. You can easily see where CyberConnect2 drew their inspiration from: there's the Monster Hunter-like "temporary food bonus" mechanic, JRPG camping, and even Persona-like "relationship building" which is more like a grid that increases your stats a little bit. Some of it feels empty, while other portions are lively. Each NPC looks like it was designed by famed artist Akira Toriyama himself, adding character to this bright and silly world. Fishing, while overly simplistic and rote, will garner a gigantic demon fish as an over-the-top reward. Even if you're going through the motions sometimes (perfectly exemplified by placing tokens of people you meet on a mostly time-wasting skill board for menial stat pumps), you can't help but smile. Unlike the menu portions, the exploration parts really got me going most of the time. Sure it's gamey, especially the Crackdown-like Z Orbs (which you can randomly find cobbled about the world and grant bonuses when collected en masse). But in a universe where people turn into ape-men when witnessing a full moon and can come back to life after being granted a wish from a legendary dragon: it fits. Flying around aimlessly is fun and that counts for a lot. Kakarot's action is similarly serviceable. Your job is to defensively guard or dodge (as well as use Ki, or super meter, to trigger an instant teleport dash) and fight back with your melee and ranged tools — the latter of which can be as small as a single blast or a gigantic Ki-draining super. Combat is properly cinematic, occasionally bursting through mountainsides or slamming foes into craters when the situation arises, bolstered by the anime-like visuals that CyberConnect2 is so good at. It can be basic, especially early on when your skills and party members are limited. And given that you're fighting a CPU throughout, it can also be gamed, without the option to slide the difficulty up (or down, for that matter). Fights are give-and-take, with some of the more iconic bouts in series history going down like slobberknockers, and others feeling like "over before it started" skirmishes. A few of the more "cinematic" moments can also overstay their welcome when they pop off multiple times to the point of "okay, we get it." CyberConnect2 could take some inspiration from Azure Striker Gunvolt's desperation supers that only trigger once for dramatic effect. Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot review I think where Kakarot gets it right is that slow burn of power. Like the show, Goku is presented with insurmountable odds, only to eventually overcome them through some help from his friends (signified by assist attacks) or a newfound ability (which translates to a new gameplay mechanic). The story of DBZ is conducive to a good old-fashioned gaming power fantasy, though no one has really managed to strike a great balance yet. Kakarot, for the first time in a while, flirts with it. Focusing on lots of great low-key moments like Goku's Ordeal is a smart move. But from a macro-perspective, Kakarot is still 40 hours long, and filled with lots of moments that don't feel earned for the sake of padding. You really need to be in the right mindset to play through it without taking extended breaks. Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is not the anime game to end all anime games. It's not going to convert any non-believers or onboard them into this decades-old classic universe. Even as someone who still re-watches DBZ, it can be grating at times ⁠— but the juice is mostly worth the squeeze.+++6
Legends of Runeterra could give Hearthstone and Magic: Arena a run for their money 2020-01-24 15:00:00by Chris Carter 0 Finally, some competition As a heavy digital card game player, I've seen many projects rise and fall. Every IP in existence from Fable to Elder Scrolls to DOTA can get a card game these days, and in the face of adversity (read: mostly Hearthstone), fail. Others, like Ascension and Eternal, have carved out a nice little niche for themselves, co-existing in harmony. But Legends of Runeterra is on a different wavelength by virtue of it launching with the full might of Riot Games behind it. I hope it sticks around. Legends of Runeterra Legends of Runeterra derives its name from the very universe that League of Legends takes place in, and serves as a card game spinoff of that same franchise. Your job is to play cards in a 1v1 competitive fashion and defeat the enemy's Nexus (base). Cards generally have an attack and health rating (units) and heroes have level-up opportunities through fulfilling certain requirements and wacky powers (like Elise's ability to create spiders when attacking). Turns progress as players commit units to attack or defend (an "attack token" is swapped to denote the altered tactical flow), then watch the turn play out until one Nexus falls. On a base level, of course. You also have to account for all sorts of abilities, keywords (such as frostbite, which turns an enemy attack rating to zero for a turn), and mana costs for cards. Spells can make things pretty hectic, especially of the burst (instant, if you play Magic) variety, which can be played out of turn. Players also can't put down units when attacking or blocking, so managing your army and your card pool is important at all times. Some spells can even grant you an attack token out of nowhere. Think of it as a mix between Hearthstone's simplicity and Magic's complexity (with direct analogs to the latter, like the keyword "overwhelm" that's just Runeterra's version of trample). Timing and unit placement matters. The presentation deserves a shoutout, too. There's cute little voiced character interactions that fit within the playful framework of this spinoff card game. The animations are lovely, and there's a booming, bold sound design that'll be highly conducive to esport events. It also has the added benefit of Riot account integration, with linked League of Legends friendlist access. Riot is becoming a regular 'ol Blizzard before our eyes. Another important thing to touch on: the monetization model. Booster packs to help build up your 40-card decks (with a cap on six Champions, or heroes) are not for sale, though you can buy a limited amount of cards per week in the form of wildcards. This is the plan for now, as cosmetics like new boards (playing spaces) and pets try to pay the bills. It's all pretty early yet, but so far there's a lot of promise here. The idea of capping purchases so whales can't drop hundreds of dollars a month on the game is not investor-friendly, especially for card games that sustain themselves on said whales. I can't see this working out long term as the limit is slowly raised, but I like the moxie of it (even if some of it is self-serving to try and avoid looming loot box legislation) and the attempt to do something different to steer away from blind packs. Who knows: maybe if loot boxes get off the legal hook and the game doesn't make enough money, the floodgates will open. Legends of Runeterra is currently in beta, and is scheduled to launch "in the first half of 2020" on PC and mobile devices. There will be no more account wipes or resets from this point on.+++6
Damn you Apple Advertisement I'll be the first to admit I'm not much of a mouse & keyboard gamer. For starters, I've been a member of the cult of Mac since high school, going from an eMac to a Mac Mini to my current MacBook Pro. This spring, I'm trading in my current rig for one of those dope ass iMacs. In the same time I've been tethering myself to hardware out of One Infinite Loop, handheld devices have provided me with a majority of my gaming experiences with select other titles strewn throughout. The pendulum started to turn the other way about six years ago. Steam launched for Mac OS X in 2010. I downloaded it right away for the free copy of Portal, but didn't do too much with the client as World of Warcraft was my current obsession. When I upgraded to my current MacBook, a coworker goaded me into going all-in with Steam. With increased Mac OS support from developers and cheap-ass prices from Steam Sales and various Humble Bundles, my library exploded from just a couple of games into a collection that easily dwarfed every other gaming device I owned. Today, I logged into my Steam account to find a majority of that collection no longer works. Guacamelee It's not a total surprise some of my Steam games are no longer compatible with my laptop. Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, for instance, became unplayable back in 2018 due to a DRM issue. But that's much different than what's going on with the rest of my library. Apple warned people for quite some time it was dropping support for 32-bit software, similar to what happened to iPhones and iPads back in 2017. If I didn't want to lose access to all these games, I simply had to avoid upgrading my OS to the current Catalina version. But by the time these warning bells were sounding, I'd regressed to my previous position as a primarily handheld gamer. My Steam library sat dormant for three years, and when that Catalina update was ready, I downloaded it without a second thought. Now I'm having second thoughts. Today, following the sudden urge to play some Lovely Planet, I discovered Steam was no longer compatible with my Mac. It was then and only then I remembered the loss of support for 32-bit architecture. As I updated the client, I prepared myself for the very real possibility that I'd lose the ability to play a few of my games. A couple maybe. A handful at most. Surely the majority of my library would be 64-bit, right? Lovely Planet As evident by the title of this piece, that's obviously not the case. It's not a couple or a handful. Nearly my entire damn library is incompatible with my computer, each lost title marked with an interdictory circle. I'm not shedding any tears over not being able to play something like Cat President or Super Seducer again. In fact, Apple is probably doing me a favor there. But The Stanley Parable? Shadowrun Returns? Doki Doki Literature Club? Scrolling through my library, it became clear just how much this update cost me. Hundreds of games no longer work, but let me just list a choice few: Half-Life 2 Bioshock Infinite Grim Fandango Remastered Hollow Knight Hotline Miami Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet Magicka 2 Portal & Portal 2 Octodad Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs Skullgirls Undertale The Witcher & The Witcher II It's an absolute crapshoot as to what still works and what doesn't. None of my Telltale games are compatible, but I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream somehow is. Gone Home is all good, while The Beginner's Guide is a non-starter. Dear Esther: Landmark Edition won't run on my laptop, but the original Dear Esther will. Dear Esther I take solace in the fact I've already purchased a few of those lost titles on other devices. I did have plans to play some of my Steam collection this year. That'll be somewhat doable with games like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Sunless Skies still operating on my OS. But when those are moved to my completed pile, I'm going to have to start thinking hard about what I want to do with the rest of that library. I could always run Bootcamp on my next Mac and restore access to those lost games, as well as the Windows-only titles I've amassed over the years. It would be nice to finally see what Alan Wake is all about. Or I could use it as an excuse to let go of it all, admitting I was foolish to spend literally tens of dollars on hundreds of games with temerarious abandon. I didn't have enough time for them then and I certainly have no time in my life now for something like Wizardry 8 or Never Alone. Maybe my Steam library should exist only as a reminder of the futility of trying to play everything; that owning many games provides only cursory happiness while true bliss is found in actually having the time to experience these adventures. Nah. I'll just buy a gaming PC and continue to lie to myself about clearing out that backlog.+++6
Rats!

Visiting the store each day gives you the option to unlock a gift -- some rat coins and part of a story. Those coins can be used to pick up event-exclusive items like "profile backgrounds, mini-profile backgrounds, chat room effects, chat stickers, and more."As for the main attraction -- you know, cheap games -- here's a small selection of some decent-looking deals: Resident Evil 2 -- $19.79 Total War: Three Kingdoms -- $44.99 Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order -- $47.99 Battletech -- $13.59 Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice -- $10.19 The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt -- $11.99 No Man's Sky -- $29.99 Disco Elysium -- $31.99 Divinity: Original Sin II Definitive Edition -- $22.49 Destiny 2: Shadowkeep -- $37.49 Half-Life: Alyx (pre-order) -- $53.99 Assassin's Creed Odyssey -- $23.99 But there are a bajillion games, so you'll really have to check it out for yourself to see if anything floats your boat.

This is how you Re Mind me of what I really am After many, many years Kingdom Hearts III finally arrived in early 2019, and it was a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Who would have guessed! Just because a project is gestating for a long time, it doesn't make it impervious to criticism. I think no matter what end of the spectrum you were on though, you probably wouldn't turn down more of it if you actually saw it through until the end. The Re Mind DLC seeks to explore both new and old ground, giving us a posthumous quasi "Final Mix."Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind review - Destructoid Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind (PS4 [reviewed], Xbox One] Developer: Square Enix Publisher: Square Enix Released: January 23, 2020 MSRP: $29.99 Re Mind (wow, no math equations to solve this time!) is a paid story DLC with extras that takes place before and after the final fight in the main campaign. Think of it as an extra quest plus an epilogue: a sendoff of sorts for Kingdom Hearts III. This is where a lot of the holes are plugged and some of the clumsier elements are finessed. We get our Final Fantasy cast member additions. We get a proper way for Kairi to contribute to the narrative. Characters that were kind of downplayed near the finale shine. You now have the option to directly choose keyblade wielders for some bouts, fighting game style. It also sports a few quality-of-life additions and an ever-popular secret episode, bolstering the main game in a bid to mostly justify the asking price. It's a very emotional and involved DLC, that's for sure. Without spoiling too much, the bulk of Re Mind is a sidequest involving Kairi and Sora that mostly takes place in Scala ad Caelum (that beautiful cityscape near the end of the main game) after a bit of retreading (which basically has you replay most of the Keyblade Graveyard segment). Given that it was one of my favorite areas in the series, I'm happy to see it expanded upon, even if it's ever so brief. There's a ton of explosive triumphant moments here in the Re Mind narrative, which exceed the qualifier of fan service since they actually make sense and tie up loose ends in a reactionary sort of way. I have to warn you: make sure you're already invested before you pick it up. After that, another chapter unlocks (Limit Cut). That's your epilogue: a boss rush mode with a story. This is where all of the crazy fights of the DLC are at, a few of which could be considered some of the toughest in the entire series. Clearing those will net you an insane secret ending that a lot of people are going to be talking about in the coming weeks. I'm keeping it vague, but the focus is on gameplay and combat with Limit Cut, a nice flourish for Re Mind's story angle. Nomura and his team really flex on the playerbase, pushing everyone to their limits to best what is ostensibly a series of superbosses. I had a lot of fun powering through these and coming back from the brink of death myriad times. I'll definitely run through them again and the one-two punch of story and pure combat with two distinct episodes was a smart move. It nudges the DLC in the right direction: without it, it wouldn't be as effective. But you really have to be a certain kind of person to enjoy it, I can't stress that enough. Like every incarnation of the game, even the Re Mind DLC is going to both confuse and excite people en masse. But now that there's "An Oath to Return" (with a future Kingdom Hearts entry), this is all we have until the next one comes along. It'll do. As long as you really, really liked Kingdom Hearts III already: others need not apply.+++6

There’s no definitive answer here, as it really depends on your gaming habits. If you intend to use your Switch for the odd multiplayer session on Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or for a few bouts in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate then an SD card isn’t vital. You probably won’t get close to reaching the limits of the console’s 32 GB internal memory. However, once you start building up a library of games or digital downloads from the Nintendo eShop then you’ll very quickly start to find that the in-built storage options are very limited. With massive hits like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Fire Emblem: Three Houses taking up so much room you’ll want to expand fast! There’s good news, though, as it’s ever so easy to bump up your storage space. All you’ll need to get is an SD card for your Nintendo Switch and those days of space anxiety will be far behind you. Which SD cards are Nintendo Switch compatible? The good news is that the vast majority of microSD cards are fully compatible with Nintendo Switch. As an interesting little factoid, the Switch SD card max capacity is up to 2 TB. Now, you shouldn’t need to worry about a card of that size, though. Not only is it a little excessive, but microSD cards of that size don’t even exist yet! Instead, you’ll want to be looking for an SD card size somewhere between 32 GB to 400 GB. Most standard brands are absolutely fine to use (you don’t really need the faster or ‘Extreme’ variants) so the smart move is just to look for the best value for money in comparison to the space you get. Our SD card picks above should more than cover that! Will these SD cards also work with the Nintendo Switch Lite? Yes! If you’ve picked up Nintendo’s new console and want to be sure you have enough storage space for your games then all of these microSD cards are also compatible with the Switch. If you haven’t got one yet you can check our page dedicated to the best Nintendo Switch Lite price. We’ve also got a look at some of the best Nintendo Switch Lite accessories to go with your new console. The Nintendo Switch and where to insert an SD card How do I insert an SD card into the Nintendo Switch? At first, if you’re not sure where to insert an SD into the Nintendo Switch, it can seem like there really isn’t a place for one. On the standard Switch, Nintendo has cheekily hidden the micro SD slot behind the kickstand on the back of the console. All you need to do is flick that up and you’ll find the SD card slot. Simply plug it in, turn on your Switch and you should be good to go. The only other thing you might need to do is format the SD card, though the Switch will let you know and handle that automatically if it’s required. Be aware, though, that this will wipe all data currently on the card, too! How do I transfer my Switch data to a new SD card? You can do this, though the process is a little more complicated than normal if you’re transferring between two SD cards. Important note: saved games are all stored within the internal memory and can only be backed up to the cloud with a Switch Online membership. Let’s start with the steps you need to take if you want to move game installs from the internal memory to a newly-installed SD card. To do this, navigate your way to data management in the system settings, choose the game you want to move, select archive and then re-download the game from the Home screen. The game will then be automatically downloaded to your SD card. If you want to transfer Switch data from one SD card to a new one you’ll need a computer with an SD card reader. First, insert your old SD card into the machine and copy the data to the desktop or a location of your choice. Then, eject that SD card and insert the new one. Finally, move the data you just copied onto the new SD card and insert it into your Switch. You should now be all good to go with all the extra space you need on the new card! Whichever SD card you go with, you’re always going to be increasing the potential of your Nintendo Switch. More storage space means more games you can have installed at any one time. Much better than clearing out the old stuff every so often. It’s especially handy if you plan on un-docking your Nintendo Switch and taking it with you on the go. Hey, if you find that’s happening more often, you might want to look at the best price for Switch Lite! In any case, we’ll be updating this page with all the best Nintendo Switch SD card deals as and when they appear so do check back regularly. For more Switch-related goodies, why not have a look at our list of the best power banks for Nintendo Switch so you’ll never run out of battery while on the go? If Mario Maker 2 is more your thing, there’s also our picks for the best Nintendo Switch stylus and some of the cheapest Nintendo Switch Online deals.+++6
Rocket League players on Mac and Linux will soon get the game’s final patch. Psyonix has announced that it’s ending support for Mac and Linux – including SteamOS – with Rocket League. The game’s next patch, due out in March, will be its last as far as the two platforms are concerned. After the patch’s release, players on Mac and Linux will no longer be able to access online features, including online play, leaderboards and the in-game market. The game will remain playable offline, however, provided future Mac/Linux OS updates don’t break it in some way. Steam owners by default get access to a Windows copy when buying Mac or Linux games, so you should be able to continue playing on Windows. While Psyonix does not officially support tools like Wine or Proton, and Boot Camp on Mac, the developer said players can use them to play the Windows version.+++6

Ori and the Will of the Wisps opens things up in the first few days, before Nioh 2, Doom Eternal, Bleeding Edge, Half-Life: Alyx Persona 5 Royal and more take over. Ori and the Will of the Wisps (PC, Xbox One) – March 11 Nioh 2 (PS4) – March 13 My Hero One’s Justice 2 (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch) – March 13 La Mulana 1 & 2: Hidden Treasures Edition (PS4, Xbox One, Switch) – March 17 PC Engine Core Grafx mini/ TurboGrafx-16 mini (PC) – March 19 Animal Crossing: New Horizons (Switch) – March 20 Fairy Tail (PC, PS4, Switch) – March 20 Doom Eternal (PC, PS4, Xbox One) – March 20 Doom 64 (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch) – March 20 Moons of Madness (PS4, Xbox One) – March 24 Bleeding Edge (PC, Xbox One) – March 24 One Piece: Pirate Warriors 4 (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch) – March 27 Persona 5 Royal (PS4) – March 31 Half-Life: Alyx (PC VR) – March Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord – Steam Early Access (PC) – March April The onslaught continues in April, which is now vying to feature an even bigger volume of highly-anticipated games. So far, we have confirmed dates for Resident Evil 3, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Gears Tactics, Trials of Mana and more.

Not this year, though, because The Last of Us Part 2 and Wasteland 3 are going to be fighting over our time (and attention) in May. Fast & Furious: Crossroads, Maneater, and Amazon’s MMO, New World, complement the remainder of the month’s offering. Marvel’s Iron Man VR (PS VR) – May 15 Wasteland 3 (PC, PS4, Xbox One) – May 19 Maneater (PC, PS4, Xbox One) – May 22 The Last of Us Part 2 (PS4) – May 29 Fast & Furious: Crossroads (PC, PS4, Xbox One) – May 29 New World (PC) – May Early 2020 No one knows for certain where the period of “early 2020” really ends, but we reckon the first quarter is a fair guess. Below, we’ve listed all games shooting for release in Q1 along with the more ambiguous “early 2020” target. Bubble Bobble Friends 4 (Switch) – early 2020 [North America] The Vale (PC) – early 2020 Warlander (PC, PS4, Xbox One) – early 2020 Spellbreak (PC, PS4) – early 2020 KungFu Kickball (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch) – early 2020 Touch Type Tale (PC) – early 2020 Hellpoint (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch) – early 2020 Cloudpunk (PC) – early 2020 Phogs (PC, Xbox One, Switch) – early 2020 Cake Bash (PC) – early 2020 Ostranauts (PC) – early 2020 Signs of the Sojourner (PC) – early 2020 Reky (PC) – early 2020 Boundary (PC, PS4) – Q1 Table Manners (PC) – Q1 The Complex (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch) – Q1 Bite The Bullet (PC, Xbox One, Switch) – Q1 Colt Canyon (PC) – Q1 Ary and the Secret of Seasons (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch) – Q1 Relic Hunters Legend – Steam Early Access (PC) – Q1 Broomstick League – Steam Early Access (PC) – Q1 Comanche – Steam Early Access (PC) – Q1 Nine Witches: Family Disruption (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Switch) – Q2 Q3, spring and summer 2020 While the games below do not yet have solid release dates, their creators are hoping to put them out around either spring or summer.

Launch games and the consoles themselves should eat up this period, to say nothing of re-releases and the like.

Pokemon: Mewtwo Strikes Back – Evolution is coming to Netflix next month. Pokemon fans can watch Pokemon the Movie: Mewtwo Strikes Back – Evolution on the streaming service starting February 27. A CGI version of the first Pokemon movie, the film was was released in Japan and Korea last summer. If you’ve never seen the film, here’s a quick synopsis: When researchers discover and exploit a fossil of the Mythical Pokémon Mew, they unleash a creation that goes against the very laws of nature: Mewtwo, a Legendary Pokémon intended for use as a tool of destruction. But as Mewtwo becomes aware of its own dubious origin, it begins to resent its human creators and seeks revenge—and Ash, Pikachu, and their friends find themselves at the center of its rampage. With the future of the Pokémon world at stake, will our heroes be able to overcome Mewtwo’s challenge… and will Mewtwo be able to find a new meaning for its life? Check out the trailer for the film below.+++6
If you’ve ever been online, which I don’t advise, you may have noticed that lots of gamers are extremely mad at Pokemon. While much of the seething anger comes from the fact that some Pokemon are missing from Sword and Shield, some fans also felt that the games were too easy. Just search Pokemon on Twitter and you’ll see a whole host of angry tweets arguing about the difficulty of a game that is, let’s be honest, made for children. While some of the missing Pokemon are set to return via DLC, developer Game Freak doesn’t appear poised to address the difficulty complaints – but groups of more productive fans have been adding their own rules to their Pokemon playthroughs for years to make things more exciting, more refreshing, and more difficult. Here are some of our favourites, starting with the humble Nuzlocke: Nuzlocke: Don’t let your monsters drop This challenge originated as an expletive-filled webcomic called Pokémon Ruby: Hard Mode, authored by someone named only “Nuzlocke”. Their name was based on the first wild catch in the playthrough, Nuzleaf, and Lost character John Locke, but the comic’s popularity came from the Hard Mode rules, which millions of fans implement in their games to this very day. Most of our difficulty-enhancing rulesets use these rules as a starting point, before twisting the details or adding further rules, so if the term is new to you, read these directions very carefully: You can only catch the first Pokemon you encounter in each new area or route. If you faint it or it runs away, you’ve failed, and cannot catch another Pokemon in that area. Try to get a random “exclamation point” encounter rather than picking from the overworld ones. If one of your Pokemon faints, it is considered dead. Release it immediately. Your job is simple: keep your team alive, and don’t white out by losing all six Pokemon in your party. There are also a couple of extra rules that fans have widely accepted in addition to the two core rules: Nickname every Pokemon. This creates a stronger bond between you and your Pokemon, making it more painful when you inevitably have to release them upon their untimely demise. It’s like XCOM with pigeons and shit. No duplicate Pokemon species. This prevents you from ending up with a boring team that consists of six of the same Pokemon. A Nuzlocke basically adds a self-imposed perma-death mechanic to your playthrough. Sword and Shield bring Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokemon to the battlefield, which can easily knock out one of your Pokemon in a single hit, making a Nuzlocker’s life even more difficult than in previous generations.+++6
Game Freak has confirmed that Pokemon Home will go live this February. As part of today’s special Pokemon Direct, Game Freak revealed a few more details about Pokemon Home. Pokemon Home is essentially an evolution of Pokemon Bank: a paid cloud service that stores players’ Pokemon, and allows them to transfer Pokemon to Sword and Shield. Pokemon Home is not tied to a single console, and will be available to anyone through a smartphone app. When the paid service launches, players will be able to bring forward Pokemon stored under their account to Pokemon Sword and Shield for now, assuming the Pokemon are part of the Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra expansions. Pokemon Home supports transferring from the existing Pokemon Bank, as well as Pokemon captured in in Pokemon Let’s Go Pikachu/Eevee, and Pokemon Go. Keep in mind that not all of them can be brought into Sword and Shield. More Pokemon Home details will be released between now and the app’s launch next month.+++6
The first Super Nintendo World theme park attraction is set to open at Universal Studios Japan this summer. There have long been plans to open up similar areas at Universal Studios locations in Hollywood and Orlando, but you'll have to wait a while longer to explore the Mario-themed attractions stateside. NBCUniversal parent company Comcast revealed in an earnings call that Super Nintendo World will be part of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando. That's scheduled to open in 2023, and it's not yet clear whether Super Nintendo World will open then. In any case, it'll be at least three years before it debuts in Florida. Executives didn't offer too many details about Orlando's Super Nintendo World (or the California version) on Thursday's call, but it'll surely ape the Osaka incarnation. That "life-size, living video game" will include a real-life Mario Kart ride, another called Yoshi's Adventures, food outlets, merchandise and, of course, games. Comcast clearly has high hopes for the attraction. An executive described it as having potentially similar drawing power to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, which "drove incremental attendance in our parks of about 2 million people."+++6
One day after EA announced that it's shutting down its mobile Tetris games, N3TWORK's Tetris app is available for download. For now, the free app comes with a traditional solo gameplay mode, but N3TWORK says it has "so much more in store."You can find the app in the App Store or Play Store -- outside of China and New Zealand -- and you'll be able to play both online and offline. Local high score tables are available now, to make sure things stay competitive, and players can choose from five themes and 50 avatars. N3TWORK Last year, N3TWORK announced it was working with The Tetris Company and would release Tetris Royale, a mobile version of the classic puzzle game with a 100-player battle mode. That title hasn't arrived yet, but N3TWORK initially said it would be finished in 2020. With the app now available, it seems promising that we'll see the battle royale version soon. "We're launching Tetris with a traditional solo gameplay mode, but we want fans to know that we've got so much more in store for them, and this is just the foundation of an incredible Tetris app experience we're building at N3TWORK," said Neil Young, founder and CEO of N3TWORK.+++6
After almost seven years, Nintendo has won a patent case that involved the original Wii. On Tuesday, the company announced that a federal court in Dallas ruled in its favor against iLife Technologies, overturning an earlier 2017 decision that would have forced Nintendo to pay out $10.1 million in damages. The original suit, which was brought against Nintendo of America in 2013, alleged that the company used iLife's technology to create the Wii's motion-sensing controller. The patent that was at the center of the case described a technology designed to detect when a person falls and monitor babies for symptoms of sudden infant death syndrome. iLife had initially sought $144 million in total damages and an injunction against Nintendo. In this latest ruling, however, the court decided that iLife's claim wasn't specific enough. The ruling ends a lengthy legal saga for Nintendo. The case involved the last of six patents iLife tried to leverage against Nintendo. In 2016, the US Patent and Trademark Office said the five other patents were invalid.+++6
SteelSeries is known for its mid- to high-end gaming peripherals -- now it's hoping to entice more players to its brand with a suite of more affordable items. It's just launched a new mouse and a couple of new keyboards, and for their attractive price points the company has managed to cram in a lot of decent specs. First up in the Rival 3 mouse. It weighs in at just 77g, features some of SteelSeries' brightest RGBs ever, and includes a brand new sensor, the TrueMove Core. The 8,500 CPI sensor features true 1-to-1 tracking, so movements are perfectly replicated onscreen. This is a pretty big deal for a mouse that costs just $30 -- at this price most companies use regular off-the-shelf desktop sensors. Then there's the Apex 3 and Apex 5 gaming keyboards, on sale at $50 and $100 respectively. While they're both more affordable than SteelSeries' Apex Pro and Apex 7 lines, they actually share a lot of similar features. The design is almost identical, for a start, with the Apex 5 using the same aluminum chassis and OLED screen, and both featuring similar wrist rests. The Apex 3 uses what the company claims are "whisper-quiet" gaming switches and is also water resistant. The Apex 5, on the other hand, combines membrane and mechanical switches for a hybrid switch. The whole line -- which does a pretty good job of bridging the gap between basic peripheral tech and premium gear -- is available globally now.+++6
Microsoft's cheapest Xbox One S is back to the lowest price we've seen, and is available for $150 at Walmart this weekend, $100 off the regular price. A few Black Friday deals saw the All-Digital version of the console drop to a price that low, but now that we're in a new year -- and we all know when the Xbox Series X is coming -- maybe it's a little more clear that you'd like an HDR-ready version of the Xbox One to hold you over. It's not as powerful as the pricier Xbox One X, but if all you want to do is watch 4K video and play a few downloaded games -- or maybe do some xCloud streaming in the future -- then it fits the bill, and for a lower price than other consoles -- even the Nintendo Switch. With this bundle, it even throws in Sea of Thieves, Minecraft and Fortnite with 2,000 V-bucks and a special skin.+++6
Kingpin: Life of Crime, a first-person shooter from 1999, is getting a remaster. If you never imagined this happening -- "I'll take games I never thought would be remastered for $100, Alex" -- we feel you. The title didn't enjoy as much popularity as it could have when it was first launched, since it was released shortly after the Columbine High School massacre and various retailers opted not to sell it. Video game developer 3D Realms, which is working on the remaster, has announced the news on Twitter for PAX South 2020. The upcoming version of the game is entitled Kingpin: Reloaded. It adds 4K and ultrawide support to the game, and you can play it in either "classic" or "enhanced" mode. As you can guess, the latter comes with improved graphics, though it looks like 3D Realms didn't change the game's character models -- their extra beefy physiques remain. In addition, the developer says it rebalanced the gameplay. Kingpin: Reloaded 3D Realms doesn't have an exact release date yet. However, it plans to launch the game later this year for the PC, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.+++6
Think back to 2001: Lifehouse's "Hanging by a Moment" was (inexplicably) the No. 1 song. NASA launched the Genesis space probe. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was released in theaters. The first click-wheel iPod went on sale. And Microsoft released the first video game console made by an American company since the Atari Jaguar. Despite competing against the PlayStation 2, Sega's Dreamcast and the Nintendo GameCube, the first Xbox would go on to sell over 24 million units. We asked readers to review the console that kicked off the critically acclaimed FPS classic Halo; here are their memories, thoughts and opinions on the hardware and its best software features. Model shows off mockup of the Microsoft Corp's Xbo Hardware The physical console itself was a chunky black-and-green box with an "X" design overlayed on the top and four front-facing slots for controllers. The majority of users recalled positive feelings about the hardware; Tony loved the console and said it reminded him of an updated Dreamcast. George said it was "built like a tank" and brought up a YouTube video "that showed someone shooting the Xbox with a gun. Then they plugged it in and it still worked." Vu2You said it "had the most powerful performance of any console, and it showed in so many games." ShawnPPickett said he enjoyed his system a great deal and never had any serious problems with it. Editor's note: We couldn't find this clip on YouTube, so please enjoy this skeet shooting one instead. If you do know what video he's talking about, please leave the link in the comments! Still, users noted that the machine wasn't without its drawbacks: Malik mentioned its size as a disadvantage. Brak allowed that the console was great "except when it overheated" -- something that was also mentioned by Marioooo, who said the "standard fan noise is not exactly desirable" though "every other aspect of the console is impeccable." Izak mentioned that his only wish was that Microsoft hadn't replaced an "excellent console after only [four] years," and Marioooo said his only "real gripe with the console was the number of revisions it went through, meaning parts could be hard to come by."Xbox Controllers As iconic as the box itself were the "Duke" controllers with their ten digital buttons, a syncing button, two analog triggers, two analog sticks and a digital D-pad. The chunky accessories were loved by some and loathed by many. TacoDave said, "First things first: the original Xbox controller was horrible." Tony echoed the sentiment stating he hated the original controller, and XJackalX felt they were "very awkward." Only Marioooo was fond of Duke-style controllers, saying he used his for many years and loved them. Most others were relieved when the "S" controllers were available, with Tony finding they "made everything so much easier" and XJackalX saying the release of the "S" style controllers was "definitely a good idea on Microsoft's behalf."Software When it came to the software featured on the first-gen Xbox, users like LordRahl72 were in complete agreement that the Xbox Media Center software made the system "the best media consumption device for its time." Wasserja thought XBMC made the system an "excellent media center" to this day, and Malik said the ability to store games, movies, music and emulators was "mind-blowing." Dvhh said XBMC was the aspect that really made the console shine, and "made it the best media center (even beating the Xbox 360 and PS3 for the media support)."Microsoft Xbox Video Games Game selection Users couldn't spend enough time discussing was the game selection and the titles that they lost countless hours playing. ShawnPPickett said he bought his console "based solely off of some of its exclusives (Jade Empire, KOTOR 1+2, Fable, Halo 1+2)." XJackalX was also a Halo fan, saying the game "definitely established the Xbox as the consoles for FPSs" and "probably saved Microsoft's console industry." Malik reminded us that "Halo was first established on this system and it became one of the all-time greatest games." GoFake1 also had fond memories of Halo. But Halo wasn't the only title fondly remembered by users. Woody24 said: "Riddick was probably the best game I played on the system, completely underrated." Marioooo said his go-to games were Need for Speed, Project Gotham Racing and Burnout. And XJackalX said "other decent titles were Crimson Skies and Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath," though he also spent time playing Burnout 3. LordRahl72 said, "To this day, I am still waiting for a modern version of Rallisport Challenge 2!"Nostalgia Many users shared their favorite memories of gaming on the first generation Xbox console, recalling what it was like to experience the system 18 years ago. It was, as Cjtylr said, "SICK back in the day." BillH said he "remembers using dual-stick controls for the first time. It took some getting used to, but I was young and getting blown up in multiplayer while running sideways was the most fun I could have."Ggonz80 "purchased the original Xbox when I was a freshman in college and it was a great gaming system. My friends and I spent many hours battling in Madden tournaments." TacoDave has "so many good memories related to the original Xbox, but none quite so stirring as four-player, split-screen Halo with friends. I had a group that would come over every Sunday afternoon for months on end and we would just play Halo for hours. Nothing beats in-person, in-the-same-room, split-screen multiplayer. Nothing."At least three users still have their original systems: In fact, Marioooo still owns three. George still has his in the living room, "sitting next to my 360 and Xbox [One]." And Woody24 just found his Xbox in the garage this past summer. "I opened the system up to remove the corroded capacitor, fired it up and started Riddick all over again. It will now find a new home in my TV center next to the PS4, Xbone, Genesis/32X/CD, SNES, PS2 and NES."Christmas Shopping Season Arrives Overall Some users, like Nazukeoya, now feel the first Xbox system was lacking. Their first experience with it at E3 in 2001 left them "completely unimpressed ... GoFake1 said the Xbox "was my first game-console experience, and it could have gone better." And Cjtylr felt that "unfortunately, by today's standards, the graphics are bad, it lacked any online support and didn't have a huge game library."However, most users were more positive. George said the console "broke a lot of ground in graphics, capabilities and online play," while Malik said the "Xbox is a great system." JSicilia1 agreed that it was a "great system for its time," and even Cjtylr admitted that despite the flaws they mentioned above, the first-generation Xbox "was a game-changing product."+++6
Google is reportedly working to bring Steam to Chromebooks. Kan Liu, director of product management for Google's Chrome OS, shared the news with Android Police. Unfortunately, Liu didn't reveal a timeline or share which games might be available. On Chromebooks, Steam would be enabled by Chrome OS's Linux compatibility, Liu said. Since Chrome OS is essentially based on Linux, and there is Steam for Linux, bringing Steam to Chromebooks might not be as a big of a stretch as it might sound. It is unlikely that we'll see the full library of Steam games, and that's probably for the best. Chromebooks don't have good graphics cards, so not all games would transition well. Though, Liu told Android Police that more powerful Chromebooks are in the works, and with each new generation of Chromebooks we are seeing more local storage. Liu also suggested, but would not confirm, that Google is working directly with Valve. If Steam does arrive on Chromebooks, it will make Valve the first major game storefront on a platform that has been walled off from PC and console releases. Engadget has reached out to both Google and Valve for confirmation and comment.+++6
Microsoft has been experimenting with streaming Xbox games to Android phones and tablets for a while as it looks for an answer to the PS4's Remote Play. Now, after opening a limited beta late last year, all Xbox Insiders in countries that support Xbox One can have a go. The list of requirements is fairly hefty: As well as being inside an Update Preview ring, you'll need an Android device running Marshmallow, or higher. You'll also need to own a Bluetooth Xbox One controller, and a speedy home network to ensure your setup can cope with streaming. Microsoft's Jonathan Hildebrandt says that the company views "the public preview as an important step in our journey to deliver game streaming to Xbox players around the world." He added that the company has been pleased by the feedback given by early-access testers in the US and UK since tests began. Hildebrandt also said that users can expect performance updates, and more, in the near future with the next update. Hopefully, it won't be long before everyone can grab some game time while they're away from the living room.+++6
Google has partnered with BT, one of the UK's largest internet service providers, to get its video game streaming service in more homes. Starting today, anyone that signs up for a Superfast Fibre 2, Ultrafast Fibre 100 or Ultrafast Fibre 250 package will receive a free Google Stadia Premiere Edition. If you need a refresher, that includes a 'Clearly White' Stadia controller, black Chromecast Ultra, and three months of Stadia Pro, a subscription service that lets you stream a bunch of different games including Destiny 2 in up to 4K resolution and 5.1 surround sound. For reference, the Premiere Edition normally costs £119 in the Google Store. After the first three months, you'll need to pay £8.99 per month to keep Stadia Pro. You can let the subscription expire, though, and still have access to Stadia Base, a basic storefront that lets you buy games individually and play them (via streaming) in up to 1080p resolution. BT's offer is available until January 30th. Then, on February 7th, the company will offer various "Superfast Stadia gaming plans" that include a Stadia Premiere Edition. It's not clear exactly how these deals will differ from what's being offered today. (BT has merely confirmed that they'll be available with Superfast Fibre 2, Ultrafast Fibre 100 and Ultrafast Fibre 250.) An ongoing Stadia Pro discount, for instance, would be intriguing. For Google, it's an obvious move. Stadia's launch was met with some lukewarm press coverage -- a curious platform with promise, many concluded, but not something that everyone needs just yet. For now, Google's biggest problem is awareness. It can't increase Stadia's install base unless people know it exists. The company made some attention-grabbing TV adverts, but it's unclear if they've made a real dent in the public consciousness. Recruiting BT, which often takes out massive billboard ads, will only help its cause in the UK. Still, it could be difficult to penetrate a market that is already rife with gaming platforms and subscriptions.+++6
Sony will release its 2017 PlayStation 4 exclusive Horizon: Zero Dawn on PC later this year, according to Kotaku's Jason Schreier. Citing three sources "familiar with Sony's plans," he says the company will likely sell the game on both Steam and the Epic Games Store. Other details on the port are scant at the moment. For instance, we don't know if Sony will include the game's excellent Frozen Wilds downloadable content in whatever base package it sells. However, as with most PC console ports, you'll likely be able to play the game at a higher frame rate than the 30FPS it's locked to on the PS4. If the report is accurate, Horizon Zero Dawn will be the second major PS4 exclusive to make its way to Windows in 2020. In October, Kojima Productions made the surprise announcement that 505 Games will release Death Stranding on PC sometime this summer. Notably, both games run on the Decima game engine, which was created by Guerrilla Games, the developer of Horizon Zero Dawn. Last year, Detroit: Become Human, Beyond: Two Souls and Heavy Rain, came to Windows without Sony's involvement. While Breath of the Wild overshadowed it in a lot of ways, there's still a lot to admire about Horizon Zero Dawn. Not only is the game's bow-focused combat fun, but the story of protagonist Aloy stands out as one of the best from a video game in recent memory.+++6
The weekend is for going climbing after taking some time off for an injury. Hopefully all that moping around with ice packs has healed me, because not climbing is a bummer. The weekend is also for video games, because you can’t climb all the time—that is, apparently, how you get injured. I played some Overwatch with my friends last weekend. I probably haven’t touched that game in a year, and even though I’ve kept up with all the new maps and heroes, I was completely lost for a good part of our “Mystery Heroes” rounds. Despite an abysmal performance, it did remind me that Overwatch is super fun, and now I’m excited to regain my bearings and return to my status as a thoroughly mediocre Overwatch player. What about you? What are you playing?+++6
When the Nintendo Switch arrived, I decided it was the first console on which I’d buy all my games digitally to improve its portability. Not having to wrangle a pile of cartridges was great, but I’m starting to rethink that approach after EA recently revealed its iOS version of Tetris was disappearing in a few months—even for those who paid for the game. Hoarding discs and cartridges for my favorite games doesn’t seem like such a bad idea anymore. If you missed the story earlier this week, last year The Tetris Company signed an exclusive multi-year agreement with a developer called N3TWORK to produce a series of mobile games based on the popular block-stacking puzzle game. As a direct result of that agreement, Electronic Arts, who had previously licensed Tetris for a collection of mobile games dating back to 2011, will not only be removing those titles from the iTunes App Store, it will also make those games unplayable on devices like the iPhone and iPad after April 21. You Soon Won't Be Able to Play EA's Official Tetris Game On Your iPhone In a stark reminder that you rarely actually own anything you buy digitally, Electronic Arts’ iOS… Read more It’s not uncommon for developers to abandon games years after release. In this case EA’s license for Tetris had simply run out, but maintaining and updating games costs time and money, and often times it simply doesn’t make financial sense to pump more resources into a title once sales have slowed to a trickle, or once a sequel is about to hit the market. But unless a game is completely dependent on a remote server to work, there’s nothing stopping you from enjoying a game even years after a company has walked away from it assuming you’ve still got the right software and hardware needed to play it. There’s always the chance an older game won’t be compatible with a major OS update—there’s an entire folder of games on my iPhone that require an update before they’ll work with the latest version of iOS—but doing that iPhone update was a decision on my part, I knew the consequences. What’s concerning about the EA incident is that ultimately it was a couple of corporations that made the decision to make the iOS versions of Tetris unplayable after April 21. And thanks to verbage buried in EA’s terms of service, no one who shelled out a couple of bucks for the game had any say in the matter. It was a stark reminder that you rarely actually own anything you purchase digitally; you’re instead only leasing that item—be it movies, music, books, or video games—until a corporation decides to reclaim its digital property. Ebooks Purchased From Microsoft Will Be Deleted This Month Because You Don't Really Own Anything... Anyone who bought ebooks through the Microsoft Store is in for a rude shock in the coming days. The Read more There’s not much you can do in situations like this. The fine print you usually ignore but agree to while quickly clicking through the signup process of online services and app stores gives companies all the legal freedom they need to do things like this. It’s something I came to realize years ago, and it prompted me to start collecting copies of my favorite video games from the past 30 years to ensure I never lose access to them. My amateur attempts at archiving video games takes a two-pronged approach. Whenever possible, getting my hands on an original game disc or cartridge is by far the more satisfying pursuit. The hunt itself can be just as enjoyable as actually finding a game I’m looking for, whether it’s pouring through listings on eBay or Craigslist, or exploring a used video game store I haven’t already cleaned out. Illustration for article titled You Should Hoard Physical Copies of the Video Games You Love Photo: Andrew Liszewski (Gizmodo) That being said, there are some challenges to this approach, and not just losing lots of shelf space to stacks of old cartridges. Often times you’ll need to pry open a game and replace a long dead battery used for saving progress and scores. It also requires you to maintain a working collection of old hardware for actually playing these cartridges, which can be expensive as consoles become harder to find. But thanks to companies like Analogue and Hyperkin who’ve recreated classic consoles like the SNES, Game Boy, and Sega Genesis, enjoying original games on modern TVs has gotten a lot easier in recent years. No matter what happens to Nintendo, I know I’ll be able to play classics like Super Mario World and Goldeneye for decades to come. The Ultimate Game Boy Clone Perfectly Plays Every Classic Handheld Game You Ever Loved It’s become painfully clear that Nintendo has no plans to release a throwback console to celebrate… Read more The other approach I take to archiving video games (dare I say it?) are ROMs: DRM-free digital copies of games that can be played through either software or hardware emulation and can be safely stored away on drives without the risk of them mysteriously disappearing one day. (Assuming you don’t accidentally drop said backup drive.) Finding ROMs online is much easier than trekking to a random store to buy a tiny plastic cartridge, but the approach has long been a legal gray area. To the best of my knowledge no one is doing hard time for downloading a copy of NES Excite Bike, but the hoops you have to jump through to acquire ROMS online is a reminder that game developers aren’t particularly fond of the idea. The other downside to the ROMs approach is that emulators can get real close to simulating the hardware of a classic console, but the gameplay experience is never 100 percent accurate. You’ll often have to deal with dropped frames, slowdowns, visual artifacts, and even bizarre sounds that are constantly reminding you of the compromises that come with emulation. Over the past couple of years there have been some major improvements when it comes to third-party consoles that are capable of playing classic games—handheld systems like the PocketGo and the upcoming Analogue Pocket come to mind—and they’re only going to improve further as mobile processors continue to become cheaper and more powerful. Fortunately for me most of the games I actually want to preserve are from consoles long gone from store shelves. But I realize my approach isn’t as feasible for games on modern devices that often require hours of software updates as soon as you slide a game disc into the console. You can hold onto that physical copy of Red Dead Redemption 2 as long as you want, but if it’s dependent on validation from a random server that’s no longer online in 20 years, having a plastic disc won’t do you much good. For the Nintendo Switch at least, I’m going to stick to cartridges from here on out wherever possible.+++6
Long ago, when I was much younger and had more free time, I would pull apart old PCs and build new ones. It was fun. I didn’t know what I doing and over time I learned what RAM was and what a motherboard is. Then I stopped doing that, bought some consoles and only bought pre-made PCs at Walmart that I would use mainly for writing. But last year I bought an actual gaming PC and have since been improving it. Recently, I finally replaced the video card and it was an ordeal. Back when I was younger, all the PC parts I had access to were cheap and old. All the parts were covered in dust or were part of the computers that nobody wanted. Breaking anything didn’t matter. Because it was all garbage and leftovers anyways. But when I decided to install a brand new video card into my main and only computer, which I use for work too, things became a lot more stressful. I did all the research and found the video card I wanted. And it was on sale on Black Friday. So I went down to the store with some family and picked it up, then brought it home and began the process of installing this damn thing. ETC. Installing A Video Card TYPE OF GAME Puzzle LIKED Better graphics DISLIKED The fear I felt removing it, Seeing my motherboard flex DEVELOPER AMD/XFX PLATFORMS Inside your computer TIME PLAYED 15 minutes of installing, 10 minutes of panic When I was a kid, getting into PCs was tricky. Most of the computers I was working on were old plastic and metal boxes. Nothing just opened easily. Sometimes I would break cases trying to get to the guts of an old Compaq. But today, PCs are so easy to open. My case has three hand-tightened screws to take off and that’s it. After doing that I was face-to-face with my PC’s innards. The first thing I needed to do was remove the video card. This involved removing some screws on the outside of the PC case. The new video card didn’t come with any instructions or tips, so as I worked on the PC my girlfriend looked up instructions online. The first site she found wasn’t very helpful. “It just says, remove the old card carefully and replace it with the new card, making sure to plug all the cables in before closing the case.” Very helpful. The thing is, and I knew this as I nervously began poking at my old video card, there isn’t much to installing a new video card. It is, at least on paper, very easy. But I have big hands and I’m a bit clumsy, so as I started to pull out the old video card I couldn’t really SEE what I was doing. Though I did see something: The motherboard started to flex as I pulled on the card. “Shit!” I stopped and paced around a little bit. I could feel my heartbeat and even though it was nearly 2 AM and I had been shopping all night, I wasn’t tired anymore. The last thing I needed was to break my motherboard. I still needed a PC to work on. Plus I didn’t want to buy and install a new motherboard. Illustration for article titled Installing A Video Card: The iKotaku /iReview The last time I installed a video card was way back in the early 2000s. I wanted to play Battlefield 1942 and Alien Versus Predator 2. But they wouldn’t work on my computer. I called the support line listed on the back of the box of AVP 2 and eventually was told I needed a better video card. After convincing my parents to buy one for me, I got home and installed it. The games worked and I played them for years. I have no idea how I did that. I didn’t even really understand what a graphics card was and yet I was able to install it and start playing. Younger Zack was, it seems, smarter than I realized and braver. So after pacing for a few minutes that memory of young Zack installing a video card entered my head. I can do this. So I got back in there and start pulling again, but this time I also pushed forward on the card a bit and then BAM! The card was out. Putting the new card in was less scary and after a few minutes of cheering and my GF and I laughing at how nervous I was, I slid the PC back to my desk, turned it on and... nothing. The monitor said no signal. I waited. Then I turned off the PC and tried again. Nothing. The computer was making noises, the fans on the card were spinning and the computer was clearly doing something, but no picture. Great, I broke my computer. And then, as if the universe decided to finally give me a break, the monitor popped on and the computer boot screen was there. But those few minutes, where I thought I had broken my entire PC or ruined a new video card, were terrifying. I don’t need to play Alien Isolation or Silent Hill. Next time I want to feel scared I’ll install a video card.+++6
This is PDP’s $50 Afterglow Wireless Deluxe Controller for the Nintendo Switch. I have many third-party game pads for the Nintendo Switch, with all sorts of special features. While the Afterglow has a couple of neat customization features, its main draw is glowing. That’s why I am using it. Glowing is great. Many PC peripherals glow. PC hardware and accessory maker Razer has made glowing one of the fundamental features of its products, creating an entire ecosystem of game-, sound-, and video-reactive LED-strobing doohickeys. I have a mouse pad with an LED border that cycles in time with my keyboard, mouse, headset, and headset stand. That’s the PC gaming glow advantage. Meanwhile, on consoles, we get this. Illustration for article titled Let’s Hear It For Controllers That Glow Just Because They Can The LEDs in the Afterglow Wireless Deluxe Controller do not react to my on-screen actions. They don’t flash when Scorbunny evolves into Raboot. They don’t dim when I am approaching a trainer battle. They do cycle, and they can be set to any number of colors using the unit’s function and shoulder buttons. They can even be switched off, revealing a lovely, well-built, translucent skeleton of a controller. Illustration for article titled Let’s Hear It For Controllers That Glow Just Because They Can Unlike many third-party wireless controllers for the Switch, the Afterglow supports motion control, though not any sort of rumble. The back of the unit features a pair of programmable paddles, additional buttons that can be quickly mapped to any other button on the controller on the fly. The controller’s 20-hour battery life means I can have a randomly glowing piece of hardware on my desk for a nice long time before having to plug it in for more hot glowing action. But really, I’m just here for the glow. PDP has been making the Afterglow line of controllers for years now, with models for nearly every console just a-glowing away like an old glow-dog. Between the Afterglow line and its Rock Candy series of translucent plastic controllers, PDP has made console gaming a great deal more colorful. Illustration for article titled Let’s Hear It For Controllers That Glow Just Because They Can I don’t need a glowing controller, but should the opportunity present itself, I’m going to shine.+++6
The Xbox One Elite Controller Series 2 is the best Xbox controller that a person who just found $180 on the street can buy. I reviewed the Xbox One Elite Controller Series 2 based on 25 hours of testing it with games such as Call of Duty Modern Warfare (2019), Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, and Forza Horizon 4. In this video, I compare it heavily against the Xbox One Elite Controller Series 1, which I have used for around 3,000 hours since purchasing it in 2015. For example, I hold the buttons up to microphones so you can hear the differences in this new model’s actuation distances. I go pretty deep in the video, so I’ll use this post to summarize: I like everything about the Series 2 better than the Series 1. The Series 2 bumpers don’t click as heavily as the Series 1's did, which I, a mechanical keyboard lover, disliked at first. However, as I used them more, I enjoyed that they were more sublimely accessible to the hammy parts of my index fingers. Previous Xbox One controllers’ bumpers have all eluded that part of my finger, which might be why I ended up mapping the shoulders to the rear paddles for some games. The analog sticks are heavier and have a nice dark chrome finish. The controller’s internal software, in tandem with the Xbox Accessories app, apparently predicts and preemptively compensates for analog drift, though I probably would need to play a couple hundred more hours to say anything concrete about that. Something tells me this steel analog stick isn’t going to drift as much as a Nintendo Switch Joy-Con. The triggers are heavier and have a nice grippy texture. The Series 1 offered a hair trigger lock that reduced the throw distance by 25%. The Elite 2 offers a third trigger distance, which effectively turns the analog trigger into a Super Nintendo shoulder button. And I gotta say, I love that sometimes. Also, the controller’s software automatically adjusts the bottom of the trigger pull to meet the new hair lock configuration. The Elite 1 didn’t do that. The face buttons are nice. I cut my fingernails pretty short, though even I sometimes caught the edge of the Elite 1's buttons between my thumbnail and skin. The angle of approach has been made more gentle on the Series 2. The d-pad is excellent. I argued for years that the Elite 1's cross-shaped d-pad (not the weird, optional, pre-installed disco ball one) is the best for any 2D retro-style platform games. I played Hollow Knight with that d-pad! The Elite 2's d-pad felt a little stiff and sticky to me out of the box, and at the time I filmed this review I reported that it bounced a little uneasily beneath my thumb. As of this writing, I’ve put in an additional four hours with the controller, and I can say the cross-shaped d-pad now sits better on the controller than it did to begin with. I make many allusions to seasoning a cast-iron skillet in my video, and this sort of thing is why. The texture of the controller is wonderful. I feel it slipping less in my hands. I used my Elite 1 primarily with my forearms resting on my thighs, hands held out straight, elbows mostly straight though not locked. With the Elite 2's stipply, grippy texture, I feel more encouraged to press my palms together, firmly locking it in place. Thanks to this new grip texture, my fingers don’t feel as tingly and dangly as they did on the Elite 1. My favorite improvements are to the paddles. The Xbox One Elite Series 1 paddles were a little too hair-triggery for some people’s tastes. Many Elite 1 owners I’ve talked to over the past couple of years have told me that they remove the paddles because they’re afraid of accidental inputs. Microsoft might have had microphones in my house, because it seems like they have listened. The paddles now have a much heavier, more mechanical pull to them. You can hear and feel a clicky tactile bump with each pull. Together with the grip texture, these heavier paddles result in fewer accidental inputs. I love them. I also love the software side of the Elite 2's paddles: using the wickedly robustified Xbox Accessories app, you can now assign Xbox One system-level functions such as “record that” and “take a screenshot” to a paddle or button. This blows my mind. I’ll reiterate: you can now record a video clip on your Xbox with the press of a single button. Not a press and a hold and a let go, not a double tap, not a press-and-select-an-option-in-a-system-menu. I could see this feature helping me make videos. (Wow, if I bought one of these things, I could write it off on my taxes.) Maybe the biggest game changer, however, is the option to map a paddle or a button to a “shift” command. You can assign a “shifted” value to every other button on the controller. Now with the shift button or paddle held in, your roll button might become your Estus Flask button. All of this helps you play games without changing the locations of any of your fingers. When paddles originally came about on video game controllers, it was primarily to combat “The Claw,” a curious way of gripping a PlayStation 3 controller so that you can both jump and control the camera at the same time. Paddles arrived to eradicate the claw, allowing players to jump with a button on the back of the controller. Controller makers life Scuf and Microsoft have honed this idea in wonderful directions. With refinements such as the shift button, the Series 2 further minimizes the repositioning of fingers necessary when playing a game. (Mouses and keyboards are still better for shooters, though.) I noticed way too many other details about the Elite Series 2 and its lovely companion software, all of which I painstakingly point out in this video. I even run down a list of common defects of the Series 1 and try to discern if they’ve been addressed in the Series 2. I leave you with this: fancy controllers are good. They are better than stock controllers. If you think you like games now, wait til you play a game with a fancy controller. If you love your Xbox and you’re curious about fancy controllers, this is the best one. If you already own an Xbox One Elite Controller Series 1 and you want to upgrade, well, I can’t speak for you, though I can speak for myself: after almost 3,000 hours with my Elite 1, I feel the strong urge to upgrade to an Elite 2. Now I just need to find $180 on the street. By the way! If you personally liked, commented, and / or subscribed to our YouTube channel, that would definitely fuel my habit of making a lot more videos like this. I promise you might love it. There’s even a playlist of all my other videos. Wow!+++6
Sennheiser’s $200 GSP 370 Wireless Gaming Headset boasts “up to 100 hours of wireless gaming” on the back of its unassuming package. I used it for 80 hours before finally getting nervous and putting it on a charger. Known for excellent sound delivery devices, Sennheiser isn’t a company that needs loud and flashy advertisements for its gaming gear, but the GSP 370 might be a special case. It’s so easy to miss the headset’s biggest draw, looking at this package. Illustration for article titled New Wireless Gaming Headset Can Go At Least 80 Hours On One Chargei/i If you squint, you’ll see an icon in the bottom left corner of the box, next to the one that reads “Low Latency Connection”. It reads “Battery Life” and “100 Hrs”. That should be a giant sticker. Maybe a colorful pop-up feature. Hell, each box should have a tiny wacky inflatable arm-waving guy, like the ones car dealerships use, holding up a “100 Hours!” sign. Because damn. The headset alone is impressive. The soft black plastic construction is elegant and understated, simultaneously lightweight and sturdy. The memory-foam earpads, wrapped in a soft, sueded leatherette, are very comfortable. The microphone is one of the nicest I’ve experienced on a gaming headset, capturing very nice quality sound with little background noise. The GSP 370 connects to PC, Mac, and PlayStation 4 via a wireless USB dongle. Computer users can download Sennheiser’s software to switch between four different equalizer presets—flat, movie, music, or esport (with a focus on treble). There’s a volume control knob on the side of the headset, a switch for power, and a micro USB port for charging. How do they sound? Nice. I’m not blown away, but I am very pleased. The clarity is good, the bass is strong without being overpowering or obnoxious. Nice and top-middle-of-the-road. Illustration for article titled New Wireless Gaming Headset Can Go At Least 80 Hours On One Chargei/i What’s important here is that they sound just fine for at least 80 hours without charging. The battery indicator light on the side of the unit has four different colors. At around 10 hours of remaining charge, the light goes red, and starts blinking when it drops to one hour. Yellow is for between 20 and 50 hours. Green indicates 50 to 75 hours of charge, and dark green is for more than 75 hours. From the 80 hours I’ve used the headset since receiving it and charging it fully, these colors are accurate. That’s ridiculous. I think the longest I’ve ever had a wireless headset keep a charge is something like 15 hours. I’m sure there are plenty out there that run for more than 15, but over 80? That’s outstanding. Before I used Sennheiser’s GSP 370 gaming headset, I would not have dreamed about starting a stream or going on a guild raid in an MMORPG wearing a wireless headset, mainly because I don’t raid anymore and hardly ever stream. But if I did, I’d be confident doing so with the GSP 370 on my head. Maybe they could put that on the box.+++6
Bundled with a first-of-its-kind USB-C 2.4GHz dongle that fits nicely in the bottom of the Switch, SteelSeries’ $99 Arctis 1 Wireless gaming headset is the first truly wireless headset for Nintendo’s latest console. It’s very nice. I just don’t see myself using it a lot, at least not on the Switch. The Arctis 1 Wirelessly works spectacularly well with the Switch. SteelSeries’ Arctis line has a lovely, mellow soundscape that’s never too harsh or heavy on any end of the spectrum. The SteelSeries Engine software lets users further customize their audio experience, fine-tuning equalizer settings and mic volume. They’re light and comfortable. This particular model comes with a detachable ClearCast mic with noise canceling that sounds quite nice in my noisy living room. It claims a 20-hour battery life, and so far it’s held close to those claims. All-in-all, it’s an excellent mid-range gaming headset. Handy on-ear controls are handy and on-ear. Handy on-ear controls are handy and on-ear. It works well with the Switch. Plug in the dongle, hit power on the headset, and crisp, clear audio is piped into your ears. They sound great. The mic does a fine job of transmitting my voice in the handful of games that support direct voice chat and don’t require Nintendo’s mobile phone app. And when I want to play in handheld mode with a power cable attached, so I can charge and play at the same time, I am shit out of luck. Illustration for article titled I Dont Think I Need A Wireless Switch Headset When the battery on my Switch begins to die, the wireless headset must go bye-bye. There is no pass-through on the Arctis 1 Wireless’ USB dongle, so it’s either wireless sound or power. I can, however, plug a wired headset into the Switch in portable mode and never run into that problem. Seeing as I never play the Switch in portable mode from across a room, a short headset cable does not bother me. SteelSeries includes a number of cables with the Arctis 1 Wireless. For the Switch in docked mode there’s a USB-A wire that terminates in a USB-C socket the dongle can be plugged into, so it’s possible to use the headset in docked mode. There are a bunch of headsets out there that plug into USB-A for wireless, so the Arctis 1 isn’t special in that regard. No, the main drawn for Switch owners is plugging that dongle into the bottom of the console. It’s just not really that much of a draw in the long run. Illustration for article titled I Dont Think I Need A Wireless Switch Headset It might not be perfect for the Switch, but the Arctis 1 Wireless is still a damn fine wireless gaming headset. I’ve been using it on my laptop, its dongle fitting neatly into the USB-C socket. It’s the same functionality as using the headset on the Switch, only now I can tweak with the SteelSeries Engine software whenever I please. With the included 3.5 mm cable I can plug the headset directly into my Xbox One or PlayStation 4 controller (the PS4 also sorts the USB-A dongle cable if the need arises). The Arctis 1 Wireless is a pretty versatile gaming headset. I might not use the first truly wireless Switch headset for the Switch, but use it I certainly will.+++6
The $330 HyperX Cloud Orbit S delivers some of the most impressive sound I’ve ever experienced in a gaming headset. It’s outfitted with Audeze’s 100mm planar magnetic drivers instead of conventional cone drivers but it’s the weird head tracking trick it does that’s impressed me the most. Yeah, the Cloud Orbit S has head tracking, a feature one expects from a virtual reality headset, not so much in a traditional pair of headphones. When the “Waves NX” technology is activated, the headset tracks head movement nearly 1,000 times a second. This data is used to detect where the user’s ears are relative to the audio source and adjust stereo sound accordingly. Illustration for article titled These Headphones Change Sound Based On Where Your Head Isi/i For example, if I am listening to music with my laptop in front of me and activate the 3D audio feature, turning my head causes the music to shift to whichever side is facing the screen. Pressing a button on the bottom of the headset centers my position, making whichever direction I am facing the audio source. To test how accurate the head tracking is, I loaded up the configuration software and played a little of Minmi’s recent English version of “Shiki No Uta,” the end theme from the anime Samurai Champloo. As you can see, I cannot help moving my head about while listening to the song. Also note the software has a “Head Circumference” option. As a man with a giant head, I appreciate it. It’s a silly feature for things like listening to music or attending the morning meeting of your gaming website. I don’t need positional audio while discussing story ideas or listening to old Yes music. The Cloud Orbit S is outstanding for both of those things, with multiple equalizer settings to cycle through and incredibly low distortion thanks to those fancy planar drivers. The microphone is one of the nicest I’ve used on a gaming headset, even if I did immediately lose the slip-on pop filter. Illustration for article titled These Headphones Change Sound Based On Where Your Head Isi/i Where the head tracking comes in handy is, of course, while playing games. The head tracking helps the Cloud Orbit S deliver 7.1 positional surround sound with a degree of subtlety that’s sublime. It’s so smooth and natural, no jarring transitions. Together with the clarity and quality of sound coming from those planar drivers, the headset has elevated the audio experience of every 3D game I’ve played. The HyperX Cloud Orbit S is also well-built and comfortable, with nice oval faux-leather ear cups and a fair bit of padding in the headband. It’s got on-ear controls for 3D audio, mic and headset volume control, and a switch for muting the mic altogether. It comes with two USB cables and a standard 3.5mm audio cable to connect to a wide variety of devices. It’s worth noting that the headset’s fancy planar magnetic drivers will not work without power, so if the headset is being used with the 3.5mm cable, it will require charging after about 10 hours running at mid-volume. Illustration for article titled These Headphones Change Sound Based On Where Your Head Isi/i The HyperX Cloud Orbit S is a very fancy gaming headset with some very fancy features and a very fancy $330 price tag. There’s a $300 “basic” model, the Cloud Orbit without an S, that has the cool planar drivers, the 7.1 surround, and 3D audio, without the head tracking. No one “needs” the head tracking, but it’s so neat, and if you’re already spending that much on a headset, you might as well spend $30 more to look silly moving your head in time with the configuration software robot.+++6
Magic: The Gathering Arena isn’t the same as ripping open Magic packs with your childhood best friend on a sunny park bench, but it is the next best thing. The digital card game, available on PC, smooths down the coarser aspects of paper Magic games, making for an easy landing pad for newbies and a great user experience for Magic veterans. This piece was first published on May 15, 2019. We’re bumping it today for the game’s official launch. Released in open beta last September, Magic Arena is the second video game adaptation to recreate the 26-year-old paper-card game. The first was 2002’s Magic: The Gathering Online, which, to gamers outside its dedicated fanbase or spoiled by Hearthstone’s delightful user experience, may now look clunky and unfriendly. Magic Arena is slated for a full release sometime this year, but right now, it’s a fully playable game that’s widely been well-received by newbies, lapsed fans, and hardcore players alike. Just like its paper-card predecessor, Magic Arena is—on its most basic level—a strategy game that has two players pit their Magic decks against each other. One loses when their health is depleted from 20 to 0 or when they attempt to draw a card after the entire deck has been played or milled. Card types include creatures, which can deal or block damage; sorceries, which cast spells; enchantments, which cast long-term spells; and more. To “cast” a card, players must have the requisite amount and color of mana, Magic’s name for resources. Illustration for article titled iMagic: The Gathering Arena/i: The iKotaku /iReview Last week, three researchers published a paper arguing that Magic is so complex that it could stump a computer. It is; at its highest levels, it’s a game of poker-like odds crunching, cold-reading opponents, research, and big-variable calculations. Deck construction relies on balancing powerful cards against the need for coherent, interlocking mechanics. Luck plays its part, too. There’s a reason that hobby shops are still packed with players excitedly peeling apart packs at new Magic sets’ prerelease tournaments. The game has one of the highest skill ceilings out there with an enticingly low barrier to entry. ADVERTISEMENT Magic Arena is pushing that barrier to entry right into the ground with its clear emphasis on accessibility, riding on the heels of Hearthstone’s success. I’ve played Magic casually since college and, over the last two years, started regularly attending tournaments in hobby shops. Magic Arena’s digital environment has been nurturing enough to help me start taking the game seriously. It offers a thorough gameplay tutorial —perhaps too thorough—complete with five educational games against a computer. Seasoned and intermediate players will find these games tiresome and the voice acting a little cutesy; beginners and lapsed players will find them essential. Magic Arena streamlines tedious aspects of physical gameplay while lengthening the ones that inspire deeper strategy. For example, it helps to see opponents’ card layouts and create decks using the same card more than once. A more subtle feature is seeing each stage of combat made distinct. Arena separates each phase, making it possible to fathom subtle openings for instant spells or creature casting that even intermediate players may not have otherwise capitalized on. Assembling decks is seamless, too, and people who were intimidated by paper cards now have less to fear. Magic Arena automatically sorts and organizes cards by color, mana cost, card type, whatever, in a way that makes it easy for players to conceptualize potential strategies and combos. Also in the category of user-friendliness, I love always being able to catch a game of Magic’s booster draft (where players assemble decks by taking one card out of a pack before passing it to the next person) and sealed deck (where players create decks using the contents of several new packs). Magic Arena has been a gateway for me to participate in these games without competing at a hobby shop and—I’ll say it—being the only woman in there. Typically, I played Magic with decks I’d hastily assembled with friends or official pre-constructed decks. Often enough, that’s fun, but if somebody shows up with their asshole goblin deck or their “mill all of my cards” deck, I don’t have a great time. Playing Limited—the name for those modes—whenever I want means constructing decks using the same card pool as my opponents and challenging myself to be as resourceful as possible. I prefer that to the Standard format’s tendency toward opportunistic mean-spiritedness. (Being the best in Standard, where players build decks with whatever recent cards they have in their collection, can mean hemorrhaging money on packs and single cards.) Deck-building in Magic Arena Deck-building in Magic Arena Image: Magic Arena A lot of fans are calling for publisher Wizards of the Coast to add more formats to Magic Arena. Currently, the main modes are standard constructed, sealed deck, and booster draft, ranked or unranked. Wizards will, in time. For now, I’m having a hard time tiring of the formats currently offered, especially since the current Magic set is so much fun. That said, it would be nice to pair up with a teammate for a two-versus-two game, and as it stands, Magic Arena does not currently have a friends list (players must “direct challenge” each other at the same time). Nothing will ever replace the experience of exchanging part-time job money for a foil Magic card under glass at the hobby shop. That’s a sensory experience above all—well, almost all. Getting free stuff is a close second. Magic Arena, which is playable for free, is generous with its resources (gold and gems), for the most part. Players can use these to buy packs and participate in drafts. A 750-gem bundle for $5 lets you participate in a ranked draft that comes with three packs. That same bundle of gems can be exchanged for three packs (600 gems) or card sleeves (600 gems). Physical Magic packs go for about $4 each. It’s not a bad deal, and Magic Arena offers players packs and cards just for logging in, playing, or winning, but the truth is that playing Magic Arena and spending no money means being either uncompetitive or very, very good. ADVERTISEMENT Is that an issue? Not for people who play a lot of Magic. Cards were the original loot boxes. Microtransactions come with the territory.+++6
The Nintendo Switch Lite is one of the finest handheld gaming devices I’ve ever used. It’s sturdy, stylish, and comfortable. It launches with a library that’s already over 2,500 games strong. If all you’re looking for from the Nintendo Switch is personal, portable play, it’s perfect. But is that all you’re looking for? From its first trailer, with its rooftop parties, car trips, and esports tournaments, the $300 Nintendo Switch has been a device that’s not just about which games to play but how to play them. Basic portable play is part of it, but so is connecting to a high-definition television in the living room, or slipping off a Joy-Con and passing it to a friend as easy as sharing a piece of candy. Those amazing little removable controllers, paired with hardware features like HD rumble and infrared cameras, allow Nintendo to explore new ways to combine real-world activity and gaming with products like Labo and the upcoming Ring-Con. Versatility defines the Switch. The $200 Switch Lite is not a versatile gaming device. It plays Switch games in handheld mode. It does not support television mode. While Joy-Cons, purchased separately, can be connected to the Lite, the Lite’s smaller screen (5.5 inches to the Switch’s 6.2) and lack of an integrated kickstand make tabletop play inconvenient. There is no rumble. There is no infrared camera. It still supports near-field communication for Amiibo support, and has a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope for motion control, so not all of the Switch’s extra features have been stripped away. But most of them have. As has been pointed out time and time again since the hardware was announced in July, there’s not much “Switch” in the Switch Lite. “Switch Lacking” would be more accurate, if far less marketable. Though I don’t see it as such, many consider the Switch Lite to be Nintendo’s successor to the 3DS, the dual-screened portable gaming system that’s been desperately clinging to life since the Switch launched in early 2017 and is now all but dead. I understand the comparison. Both the 3DS and the Switch Lite are devices exclusively made for portable gaming. But where the 3DS and its kin had their own ecosystem of unique games, most of which can’t be played anywhere else, the Switch Lite plays Switch games. To me the Switch Lite is to the Switch as the 2DS is to the 3DS. Both play the same games, but one is cheaper and stripped of features that some players never bothered with anyway. I would not trade my 2DS XL in for a Switch Lite. Nintendo portable meet-up. Nintendo portable meet-up. Judged strictly as a portable personal gaming system, the Switch Lite is better than the original Switch. It’s more compact, which makes it more portable. Since it has no removable parts, the Switch Lite feels much more solid and sturdy than the regular Switch in handheld mode, even though it weighs slightly less at .66 pounds versus .88. The plastic that makes up the Switch Lite’s casing has a soft and slightly rough texture to it that’s a joy on the fingertips. The three colors Nintendo chose for for the initial batch of Switch Lites, yellow, gray, and turquoise, give the device a hip, retro look. ADVERTISEMENT The battery life is slightly longer than my launch Switch, though not as long as the newer models. And then there’s the D-pad, that lovely little white cross in place of the regular Switch’s dinky buttons. I’ve been playing with the Switch Lite for several days now, and every time my thumb brushes that D-pad there’s still a tiny burst of joy. It’s only slightly bigger than the D-pad on my 2DS XL and just as shallow, but it’s responsive enough, and most importantly it’s not four disconnected pieces of round plastic. Mmmm, d-pad. Mmmm, d-pad. As a portable system, the only real downside to the Switch Lite is the screen size. Most of the time, the .7 inch difference between the regular Switch and the smaller Switch Lite isn’t a problem.. But when I play games like Fire Emblem: Three Houses, recently categorized by Kotaku’s Heather Alexandra as one of the Switch’s “extremely good games with tiny text,” my poor, aging eyes struggle even harder on the Lite. Maybe the launch of a portable-only Switch with a smaller screen will make developers more conscientious of tiny text. Or maybe we’ll just have to squint more. If my only desire was to play Switch games in handheld mode, I would choose the Switch Lite over the regular Switch, hands down. It’s $100 cheaper. It plays all the games I want to play. It looks and feels better in my hands, and it’s impossible for my chonky fingers to accidentally disconnect a Joy-Con during heated play. Yes, I have done this. But the original does a whole lot of cool stuff the Switch Lite does not do—stuff I’ve grown used to, and now feel awkward going without. Removing Joy-Cons to play multiplayer games is a Switch feature I hardly ever use, but when I have, it’s led to some pretty magical moments. My gaming is normally a personal thing, but the ability to make it social with the click of my Switch means it doesn’t have to be. Being able to drop a portable game I am playing into a dock and have it show up on my television set looking even better than it did in my hands? Also very cool. It might not seem like much of a jump, going from a small 720p screen to a large 1080p display, but the higher resolution coupled with the Switch’s increased processing power when docked can make quite a difference. Here’s a screenshot I took of the recent Switch exclusive game Astral Chain in docked mode. ADVERTISEMENT Illustration for article titled Nintendo Switch Lite: The iKotaku/i Review Here is a similar shot taken in handheld mode. Illustration for article titled Nintendo Switch Lite: The iKotaku/i Review See the jaggy hair and glasses? Compare the textures on the uniforms. It’s night and day. And while the graphical difference might not look as dramatic when playing on a 5.5 inch screen, many Switch games also perform better in docked mode, with better lighting effects and higher framerates. Even if 99 percent of my Switch play is portable, I’d still wonder if I was getting the most out of the games I am playing with the Lite. Plus the Switch Lite lacks a very important feature for a person like me who enjoys sharing their gameplay online. It has no external HDMI support. Not only does that mean no TV mode, it also means no connecting it to a capture card for grabbing footage or streaming. I spent years kicking around the idea of spending a couple hundred dollars to have my Nintendo 3DS modified with an HDMI port for recording and streaming. Scraping together an extra hundred for a Switch with that capability included makes perfect sense to me. Seen here sporting Hori’s Duraflexi Protector. Seen here sporting Hori’s Duraflexi Protector. ADVERTISEMENT Perhaps you can see the appeal of both models of Switch, and consider buying both of them to get the best of both worlds. I currently possess both a Switch and a Switch Lite. My plan is to keep the Switch proper, with its more delicate build and extra power, firmly seated in my Switch dock for television-based play. The more rugged and sturdy Switch Lite will become my travel companion, tucked into its little blue pouch and safely wrapped in a protective shell cover that I will never have to remove to disconnect a Joy-Con. I’ve set up my Nintendo account on both devices. The Switch Lite is designated the “primary” Switch on my account, which means I don’t have to connect to the internet to verify I have permission to play games loaded on it. My “secondary” docked Switch has to connect to the internet before I play a game, to verify I don’t currently have that gamerunning on the primary Switch. That’s no problem, since it never leaves the range of my Wi-Fi router. Don’t worry, your hands are probably smaller. Don’t worry, your hands are probably smaller. Transferring save data between two Switches is a painless enough process, right there in the Settings menu. As long as the save belongs to the same user, you can transfer it wirelessly. Cloud saves can be downloaded between systems as well, as long as the game being saved supports the feature. Alternatively, I could just not transfer saves at all, keeping unique records on each system. That would just mean I have to level two Puzzle Quest characters at once. Oh no. Not that. Now, I don’t need two Switches. You probably don’t, either. But if you want to add another Switch to your family’s game collection, something your kids can abuse a little bit more as they throw it into their backpacks or at their siblings’ faces, the Lite might be the answer. And there are people out there who don’t ever dock their Switches or remove the Joy-Cons who will be perfectly happy playing their games exclusively on a Switch Lite. But it’s far from a total replacement for the existing Switch. Illustration for article titled Nintendo Switch Lite: The iKotaku/i Review Photo: Heather Alexandra ADVERTISEMENT As I began, it’s one of the finest handheld gaming devices I’ve ever used. It’s larger, and feels more mainstream, than the quirky 3DS. It’s more rugged and earthy than Sony’s precious-looking Vita. It’s the sort of gaming hardware I wouldn’t feel bad just tossing in a bag unprotected. It’s console gaming in the palm of your hand, and you can pull it out during a rooftop party without feeling obligated to share.+++6
Joy-Cons are small. They are designed so that Switch can be a sleek, nearly-seamless handheld gaming device. Hori’s Split Pad Pro is what happens when ideas like “small” and “sleek” and “not ridiculous” are tossed out the window. The more I play with them, gripping them in my larger-than-average hands, the less I mind their chonkiness and lack of extended functionality. The $50 Split Pad Pro, recently released to coincide with the launch of Switch mech shooter Daemon X Machina, lacks a lot of features found in Nintendo Joy-Cons. It does not do motion control. It has no camera. It does not scan Amiibos. It does not rumble. The Split Pad Pro doesn’t even contain an internal battery, so it does not function in tabletop or TV mode. And good luck to you if you try to put the Switch into the dock with these attached. What the Split Pad Pro does do is transform the Nintendo Switch from a sleek handheld into an awkward-looking device that plays games quite well, especially for those of us with large paws. Instead of the Switch’s tiny analog sticks, the Split Pad Pro sports a pair with slightly more thumb surface than theXbox One’s sticks. The face buttons are larger and deeper, with a more satisfying tactile response than the Joy-Cons’. The left and right triggers are larger and more responsive as well. Illustration for article titled Big, Beefy Switch Controllers For Big, Beefy Hands Instead of four directional buttons, the left side of the Split Pad Pro sports a standard D-pad. Illustration for article titled Big, Beefy Switch Controllers For Big, Beefy Hands The Split Pad Pro also boasts a couple of features not found on Joy-Cons. Both halves of the unit sport programmable turbo functions, complete with adjustable speed. On the back of each side is another programmable button, which can be remapped on the fly to any control on the front. Illustration for article titled Big, Beefy Switch Controllers For Big, Beefy Hands With no batteries or cameras or rumble, the Hori Split Pad Pro weighs about the same as a pair of Joy-Cons, despite its additional bulk. The Switch looks ridiculously bloated with it attached but it feels quite nice. There is a little wiggle room around where each half of the controller connects to the Switch, but a tab of plastic extending from them to the back of the Switch helps maintain stability. Illustration for article titled Big, Beefy Switch Controllers For Big, Beefy Hands I played my Switch with the Split Pad Pro over the weekend, rolling through my regular lineup of rhythm games, RPGs, platformers, and the odd fighting game. I missed some Joy-Con functionality, notably the rumble effects. I did not miss the occasional cramps I get while manipulating those tiny Joy-Cons for hours on end with my large hands. I’ve only had the Hori Split Pad Pro for about a week, so I can’t comment on the long-term survivability of these large, yet lightweight, Joy-Con alternatives. I will say that whenever I foresee long stretches of handheld Switch gaming, the Split Pad Pro will be coming with me.+++6
Sega was always more loved than it was successful. At no point was the maker of the Genesis and Dreamcast the worldwide leader in video games. When it succeeded in America, it fell short in Japan, and vice versa. The Genesis Mini is an encapsulation of that moment when it came closest to victory—a reminder of what the Genesis was, but also what it could have been. To be released on September 19, the $80 Sega Genesis Mini includes 42 classic games from the 16-bit system’s lifespan. That’s a hefty amount, exactly double that of Nintendo’s SNES Classic. It also includes two of the classic three-button Genesis controllers, an HDMI cable, and a USB cable with AC adapter—in other words, everything you need to play right out of the box. The hardware is a thing of beauty, a perfect little recreation of the 1989 launch model Genesis. The Genesis Mini goes a step further than other classic mini-hardware with interactive elements. The volume control slides up and down, the spring-loaded dust-cover flaps covering the cartridge slot open and close, and you can even remove the cover for the port that would connect the real Genesis to a Sega CD. Here’s one of those photos you always have to have in these reviews, with a picture of a Mini on top of the real thing. Here’s one of those photos you always have to have in these reviews, with a picture of a Mini on top of the real thing. Photo: Chris Kohler (Kotaku) None of these things actually function, of course. You can’t play Genesis cartridges on this machine, nor is there a proportionally-sized Sega CD attachment that will let you play Sewer Shark (although surely we can all agree that we would immediately buy such a product). But they make the Genesis Mini itself into a fun little toy even before you turn it on. The included controllers feel like exact replicas of the original, massive, croissant-shaped pads that shipped with the first model of the Genesis. This is where you may feel that Sega has made a misstep with the Mini, since it includes these 3-button pads and not the 6-button controllers that were produced later. In Japan, the 6-button pads are included; here, they are an extra $20 purchase. Most of the games only use three buttons anyway, but for the ones that offer 6-button support (most notably Street Fighter II Special Champion Edition), you’ll have to pay up. ADVERTISEMENT Even though the controllers use USB, you can’t just plug in any old USB controller and have it work on the Mini—you’ll need an officially licensed controller from Retro-Bit. Sega sent samples of the 6-button controllers, which were excellent. They were helpful even for games that don’t need six buttons, since you can press the “Mode” button to open the system menu. To get to the menu with a 3-button pad, you have to hold down the Start button for three seconds, which is annoying. Shining Force. Shining Force. Screenshot: Kotaku (Sega) So was it a mistake to include 3-button pads? I’m leaning toward “no.” The appeal of a mini-console like this isn’t just the gameplay; it’s also having that little replica of the thing itself. Most people who played the Genesis back in the day used these controllers. It completes the nostalgic circle to boot up Sonic the Hedgehog again and feel one of these big chonky bois in your hands just like you remember. Like Nintendo’s classic systems, the Genesis Mini has original menu-screen music composed in classic chiptune style. Unlike Nintendo’s systems, the tune here is composed by the king of 16-bit music himself, Yuzo Koshiro (Streets of Rage and Actraiser among others). The new music is what the kids today call a “bop.” I enjoy just letting it run and listening to it. They even timed the boot sequence of the Mini to the music. That’s attention to detail! The Mini is low on software features. It’s got the obvious stuff: You can choose to either view the games in their proper 4:3 aspect ratio or be weird and stretch them out like a wacky carnival mirror across your whole TV. You can turn a “CRT filter” on and off for fake scanlines, and you can apply one of two different wallpapers to the blank space around the 4:3 image. There’s a “save anywhere” feature with four slots per game. And that’s about it. I would have really liked to see a Rewind feature like the SNES Classic’s. Wonder Boy In Monster World. Wonder Boy In Monster World. Screenshot: Kotaku (Sega) ADVERTISEMENT But all this would be meaningless without some games to play, and at 42 titles, Genesis has the most of the major minis. When you think about your childhood playing the Genesis, what game do you immediately flash back to? NBA Jam? Joe Montana Football? Aladdin? Mortal Kombat? Oh. Well, um, none of those are on this. There’s an obstacle for the Genesis Mini that the SNES Classic doesn’t really have to deal with. If you look at the best-selling games for the SNES, most of the games in the top 20 are on the SNES Classic. But look at the best-selling games for Genesis and you can see the problem: sports licenses, movie licenses, and fighting games that would earn this box a “Mature” rating. Going hard after hot licenses and pumping out games branded with big-name movies, pro athletes, and sports franchises was all part of Sega’s game plan in the 1990s. And it worked! But it also left modern-day Sega with a library of software that’s practically unreleasable today. This means that if, like many American Sega fans, you did a lot of sports gaming on your Genesis, you won’t find that experience here. Sega definitely made an attempt to get some games made for Western audiences onto the Mini, like Earthworm Jim, Vectorman, and Road Rash II. But by and large, we’re looking at a lineup of stylish Japanese action games, JRPGs, and shmups. It’s almost like the sort of Genesis collection you’d find in the home of someone who prefers the Super Nintendo. It’s a Genesis collection for me, in other words, so I’m not complaining. Contra: Hard Corps. Contra: Hard Corps. Screenshot: Kotaku (Sega/Konami) ADVERTISEMENT Here’s the full list of games. I have played each of these games, some of them for hours (Shining Force), some of them for a couple minutes (Earthworm Jim). I will hereby arbitrarily and irrevocably arrange them into four tiers: A Tier, B Tier, C Tier, and Virtua Fighter 2 For The Genesis Tier. A Tier Castlevania: Bloodlines Shining Force Gunstar Heroes Shinobi 3 Contra: Hard Corps Beyond Oasis Phantasy Star 4: The End of the Millennium Wonder Boy in Monster World Strider Monster World 4 Alisia Dragoon Dynamite Headdy B Tier Sonic The Hedgehog Ecco The Dolphin Dr. Robotnik’s Mean Bean Machine Comix Zone Castle of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse World of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck Thunder Force 3 Streets of Rage 2 Sonic The Hedgehog 2 Landstalker Street Fighter 2: Special Champion Edition Ghouls ’n Ghosts Golden Axe Tetris Darius Columns Super Fantasy Zone C Tier Space Harrier 2 ToeJam & Earl Altered Beast Earthworm Jim Mega Man: The Wily Wars Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle Sonic the Hedgehog Spinball Vectorman Road Rash 2 Kid Chameleon Eternal Champions Light Crusader Virtua Fighter 2 For The Genesis Tier Virtua Fighter 2 As you can see, no matter where you’d personally rank these games, the Genesis Mini has a deep bench. To give the console a wider variety, Sega decided to follow a one-game-per-series rule, with limited exception. While I appreciate the effort at diversity, I don’t think they should have been so strict about it. I would have preferred to play the original Streets of Rage, or Shining Force II, instead of—let me just pull one out of a hat here—the Genesis version of Virtua Fighter 2, a game that probably shouldn’t have ever even existed and really didn’t need to be resurfaced here. Darius. Darius. Screenshot: Kotaku (Sega/Taito) But in general, the lineup is strong. Previous small Genesis consoles didn’t truly represent the best of the best that the platform had to offer. Here, finally, we have top-tier action games like Gunstar Heroes and Castlevania: Bloodlines. We skip to the end of the Wonder Boy in Monster World series to get to the two that are basically side-scrolling JRPGs, underappreciated in their own time but still sharp today. SNES Classic featured an unreleased game from the 1990s, Star Fox 2, so of course the Genesis Mini had to double that count as well, adding the unreleased Genesis version of Tetris and a hardcore fan’s ported version of the arcade game Darius. Since we’re throwing back to the 1990s here, I’m going to reach back into my turn-of-the-century video game enthusiast magazine vocabulary and pronounce these a “mixed bag.” Darius is lots of fun but this port of Tetris is fairly anemic. SNES Classic wins the “unreleased game” wars, but that’s probably because only Nintendo would have ever shitcanned a perfectly good game in the first place.There’s one other important bonus feature that exemplifies how the Genesis Mini feels like more of a passionate fan project than a bland marketing tool. You can set the menu to display in many different languages, which changes the entire menu design. The menu’s look will match that region’s Genesis logo and design, switching to the “Mega Drive” name for Europe and Japan. And if applicable, the games themselves will play in that language, using alternate ROM files. Beyond Oasis actually had, for example, a French-language version. Some games differed in more than just their languages. If you switch the language to Japanese, Dr. Robotnik’s Mean Bean Machine will revert back to its original Japanese version, Puyo Puyo. Other differences are more subtle but still significant, like how the Japanese version of Contra: Hard Corps gives the player a three-bar life meter instead of one-hit kills. Or you could just play the Japanese version of Street Fighter II because you want “M. Bison” to be named “Vega.” I’m not here to judge. This extra-mile approach makes Genesis Mini a much more thorough exploration of the era than competing tiny boxes. The Genesis Mini’s menu screen when the language is changed to Japanese. The Genesis Mini’s menu screen when the language is changed to Japanese. Screenshot: Kotaku (Sega) One wonders, on the eve of this very cool device’s release, if Sega has missed the window on the mini-console craze. The market was positively flooded with copycat devices in the wake of the NES Classic’s huge success, and the bad taste of the ill-done PlayStation Classic still hasn’t fully washed out of our collective mouths. Will people line up to buy another tiny console this holiday and reward Sega for its Herculean, if belated, efforts here? Those who do add another Mini to the pile will, at least, not be at all disappointed with this one.+++6
In 2015, Atlanta-based Scuf Gaming licensed its patented controller technology to Microsoft, resulting in the creation of the outstanding Xbox Elite Wireless Controller. Scuf’s new Prestige controller for the Xbox One and PC incorporates a lot of the same technology, as well as the option for customization. It’s quickly become my second favorite Xbox One controller. The $160 Scuf Prestige includes nearly all of the features that get me excited about the Xbox Elite controller. I can replace the concave analog sticks with convex ones or a set with a longer shaft. It’s got paddle controls on its backside that can be remapped on the fly. Switches on the back of the controller let me lower the distance the left and right trigger have to be pressed to activate for a speedy, hair-trigger effect. The controller has a lovely integrated rubber grip that doesn’t seem like it would peel off even with vigorous use. It’s even got a similar battery life to the Elite controller, boasting 30 hours on a single charge. Illustration for article titled The Scuf Prestige Is The Next Best Thing To The Xbox Elite Controller The Scuf Prestige also has several features not present in Microsoft’s official Elite controller. For one, the faceplate comes off. One moment it’s held firmly in place by the magic of magnetism, the next it’s doing its best John Travalota/Nicholas Cage impression. Illustration for article titled The Scuf Prestige Is The Next Best Thing To The Xbox Elite Controller Taking the Prestige’s face off allows users to swap out faceplates. There are several different colors available on Scuf’s website. Ordering directly from the company’s online store gives the option to include an extra red, blue, white, light gray, green, or black faceplate for an additional $12.50. Were I a painting man, I’d grab a couple to customize. I am not, so I’ll probably just grab the red, because it looks pretty. Illustration for article titled The Scuf Prestige Is The Next Best Thing To The Xbox Elite Controller Taking off the faceplate is also how users swap out thumbsticks and those little plastic rings around them. In the photo below, I’ve swapped out the stock sticks with a pair of red ones that belong to a kit for Scuf’s premium PlayStation 4 controller, the Vantage. Nice to know the two are compatible. Illustration for article titled The Scuf Prestige Is The Next Best Thing To The Xbox Elite Controller The only reason I don’t prefer the Scuf Prestige to my Microsoft Elite Wireless controller is a matter of personal preference. I like a heavy controller. The Elite weighs 348 grams. The Vantage weighs 267. The Vantage is still very solid. It’s just not as weighty as the Elite. Who better to make a worthy contender to the king of Xbox One and PC controllers than the company that built the tech behind it in the first place? Scuf’s Prestige is a damn fine controller that, depending on one’s personal preference, could be even better than the Elite.+++6
If I wanted to, I could put together a gaming PC with many of the same parts as this desktop by boutique system builder CLX, but I could never make it look as good. From the striking patterned pink outer shell to the gleefully glowing innards, CLX knows how to make a gaming rig look amazing. CLX is the gaming division of Cybertron PC, a Kansas-based company that’s been putting together PCs since 1997. I first encountered the company back in 2016, when I reviewed one of its smaller systems, the “Scarab.” Though much smaller and lighter than the full-sized “Ra” model I recently tested, the Scarab packed a whole lot of power and a great deal of Egyptian-themed pretty into a compact package. Illustration for article titled Look At This Gosh-Darn Pretty Gaming PC In the three years since I reviewed the Scarab, Cybertron PC has strengthened its CLX gaming brand, distancing it from the endless Transformers jokes that plagued early reviews (mine especially). When I see CLX at a trade show or gaming convention these days, I immediately know that I am going to see something gorgeous. Case in point, the massive glass-and-metal beast that occupied my desk for several weeks. Look at that reflective metallic finish on the Phanteks Evolv X chassis. Illustration for article titled Look At This Gosh-Darn Pretty Gaming PC The custom paint job costs $300, with an additional $50 for the “Jasper” pattern. CLX took a $200 case with a nice tempered-glass side window and some nifty integrated RGB lighting and turned it into a $550 work of art. Illustration for article titled Look At This Gosh-Darn Pretty Gaming PC See the green light peeking out from inside the system on the left side of the photo? Let’s take a closer look. Illustration for article titled Look At This Gosh-Darn Pretty Gaming PC My goodness, that is pretty. Custom water cooling pipes. That gradient coolant reservoir. A total of seven internal fans. The four 8 GB DDR4 memory sticks glow. The heatsink covering the Intel Core i9-9900K CPU glows. The side-mounted Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080Ti graphics card glows. And all of the glow is customizable, with different colors and effects adjustable via remote control. Illustration for article titled Look At This Gosh-Darn Pretty Gaming PC The only bad thing about the look of the CLX Ra here is that I sit with my computers to my left, so I don’t get to enjoy the light show while I am working and playing. What I love about the CLX system, which runs around $3,300 as configured and decorated, is that its internals are almost the same as the personal PC I use for work every day. Same CPU, same video card. The CLX system has 32 GB of RAM to my 16 GB, but otherwise, it’s not far off. It’s a powerful computer capable of running all the games at 4K with all of the ray-tracing everybody keeps going on about. Illustration for article titled Look At This Gosh-Darn Pretty Gaming PC It performs nearly identically to my personal system, but it does so with grace and style far beyond that of my home-built PC with its relatively utilitarian NZXT H510 case. Where my system is a mess of wires, the CLX system is a series of internet-like tubes. While I haven’t figured out how to hook up all the RGB-lighted things I gathered for my personal system, CLX’s Ra is completely tricked out. My fans rattle slightly. The Ra has seven fans and is whisper quiet, aside from the occasional pleasant trickling sound of its coolant circulating. The CLX system is so gorgeous that I didn’t even notice I forgot to take out a bit of the foam the company packed inside the system for shipping. Did you notice? Illustration for article titled Look At This Gosh-Darn Pretty Gaming PC Yes, even with one of its case fans not spinning at all because some dork didn’t remove a bit of packing foam, the CLX Ra performed like a champ the entire time I had it, and looked gorgeous while doing so.+++6
Fire Emblem: Three Houses is a game for interesting times. At the start, none of the future rulers of Fódlan, the fantasy continent where Three Houses takes place, know that the regions they will lead are on the brink of war. Edelgard, the successor to the Adrestian Empire, is the only one who seems to have really grappled with what being a leader will mean, and it has made her cold. Dimitri, future king of the Holy Kingdom of Faerghus, is prim and proper, but his first brush with an actual battle leaves him furious about the loss of life. Claude, who will someday lead the mercantile republic that is the Leicester Alliance, has his eyes on a much bigger picture and hides his schemes behind laughs and smiles. By the time the game is finished, only one of these teenagers will succeed. Which one prevails relies on your player character, who is named Byleth by default. She dreams of ancient wars and an amnesiac girl whose connection to Byleth is shrouded in mystery. Byleth has been enlisted as a professor at the Garreg Mach monastery, where he or she teaches one of three houses: the Blue Lions, the Golden Deer, or the Black Eagles. I went with the Golden Deer after being charmed by Claude’s easygoing nature. The political struggles of each region of Fódlan are as much characters in this story as the plucky teenagers who will someday clash on the battlefield. The history of Fódlan and its primary religion, the Church of Seiros, is deep and intricate. That I can recite all the names of these places by memory—as well as the names of their ruling families—speaks to how thoroughly engrossed I was in this political conflict. While there is some fantasy nonsense going on in the latter half of Three Houses, it’s mostly a story of people and their competing desires. It also shows how those competing desires, when enacted by large political powers, can devastate everything in their path. ADVERTISEMENT Take Cyril, a student-age refugee who lives and works in Garreg Mach rather than studying there. He doesn’t want to get close to the students around him. Soon, they’ll leave the monastery, but he will still be there, cleaning up after the messes of another group of privileged kids. That they are even in the same place at the same time is an accident—in Cyril’s mind, they still inhabit wholly different worlds. Or take Dedue, Dimitri’s right hand man. He’s originally from Duscur, a formerly allied nation that was razed after they betrayed and killed the king and queen of Faerghus, Dimitri’s parents. While the people of Fódlan generally distrust people from Duscur, Dimitri speaks to Dedue like a friend and an equal. Thus Dedue has devoted his life to serving him as ably as he can, even if it means leading the kind of indiscriminate slaughter that obliterated his homeland. It isn’t just the writing that’s sharp in Three Houses. The always good tactical gameplay has been honed to a finely tuned edge with turn-based combat that captures the plate-spinning chaos of commanding of an army. Each encounter is a puzzle where the goal is to get everyone through to the end alive. In Casual mode, where characters don’t permanently die, you can take more risks, although I tried to make sure everyone made it out alive anyway—battles get much tougher when you’re low on allies. In Classic mode, which has permadeath, protecting my band of teenagers was paramount. What kind of teacher would I be if I let my children die? VIDEO GAMES SWITCH EXCLUSIVE Fire Emblem: Three Houses BACK OF THE BOX QUOTE I feel as if we're watching history being written. TYPE OF GAME Turn-based heartbreak simulator LIKED The world, the characters, the writing, the tough-as-nails combat. DISLIKED It's easy to become overwhelmed by sheer data. DEVELOPER Intelligent Systems PLATFORM Switch RELEASE DATE July 26, 2019 PLAYED 58 hours on the main story, then another 10 hours in a new save. I have to know what happens to the other houses! Luckily, in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, you get the power to rewind time using the Divine Pulse. Mapped to the left trigger, it allows you to rewind as far as you’d like in a battle when you activate it. You’ll start out with limited uses, though you’ll earn more by the end of the game. It doesn’t drastically figure into the strategy beyond acting as an alternative for save scumming, but it does teach you how to play smarter. In one particular battle, I used it to retry the same turn three times. I was trying to push myself to kill a particular low-health enemy unit before the end of the turn and keep all my characters alive in the process. In my first attempt, I had to leave one of my units out in the open, where they got ganged up on and died. It didn’t matter which character I left out there; they were destined to die unless I figured out a new strategy. So instead, I pulled back, leading that one low-health enemy to me and drawing in the farther units. The unit I had been trying to kill attacked one of my characters and then died in the counterattack. Because the other three units that had been killing my characters were closer to the whole group now, I took them out easily. ADVERTISEMENT There’s enough variance in enemy types and maps that each battlefield is a wholly different challenge. Some maps have scorching hot spots that damage characters. Others are cloaked in fog, and you can only see enemies when they’re close to you. As the game goes on, you’ll see more mounted, flying, and heavily armored units on the battlefield, making you utilize every character’s skills to take them down. You even fight giant demonic beasts who have devastating attacks and much more health than other enemies. You’ll never be able to rely on one powerful character to make it through combat unscathed. You have to learn how to get everyone working harmoniously—to use an archer to chip away at a unit’s health so that a lancer can come through with the finishing blow. Instrumental to figuring out this harmony is the time spent in Garreg Mach, where you teach your students and make them more effective in combat. Skills build over time during battle, but in the teaching phase of the game, you can speed that along or even foster new skills. Lorenz started out as a lance user, but on a whim I taught him some Reason, which is one of the two kinds of magic in Three Houses. Turns out he is an absolute beast as a magician, and by the end I had made him a Dark Knight, riding around the battlefield and setting people on fire. Although some units will always feel more effective with certain weapons over others—try as I might, the bookish Ignatz always hit harder with a bow than a sword—there’s still a surprising amount of customizability. In that way, the gameplay in Three Houses feeds into the story elegantly. As is now customary in the series, characters who help each other on the battlefield can unlock support conversations that build out their personalities and the world they inhabit. By having Marianne, a shrinking violet who doesn’t talk to anyone if she can help it, pair up with Lorenz, a haughty noble who passes the time by looking for a wife worthy of his station, you see new sides of them. Lorenz thinks Marianne is perfect just as she is, even though Marianne wishes she could change her temperament. She learns confidence from him, and through that, you see a side of Lorenz that isn’t completely obnoxious. After completing their support conversations, they’ll be more powerful when placed next to each other in combat. There are other ways to build support, too. Most of them are in Garreg Mach, where you can dine with students, fish, garden, and shop, among other activities. By the end of the game, I knew its layout by heart and even had a favorite spot to hang out (by the greenhouse, looking out on the water). Even after finishing the game, I can’t get my mind off Garreg Mach. I immediately started two new saves—one for each of the houses I hadn’t played. The characters are engrossing, the combat is pitch perfect, and the world feels fully developed, like it’s still hiding some mysteries I have yet to untangle. Illustration for article titled iFire Emblem: Three Houses/i: The iKotaku /iReview ADVERTISEMENT At one point in Three Houses, Claude tells Byleth that he feels like he’s watching history being written. The students at Garreg Mach slowly begin to feel a sense of malaise as time marches on—their futures get murkier, and their attitudes turn darker. I found myself all the more engrossed for the parallels I saw with my feelings about the real world during a time of intense political upheaval. It feels like watching a boulder roll downhill, barreling into a future I can’t control. But in Three Houses, everyone knows that what they’re doing is worth it. It isn’t pretty or easy, and it comes with more than its share of heartbreak. But it is worth it: to fight, to resist, to push for a better world. In Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Dimitri, Edelgard, and Claude all envision a future for Fódlan that’s radically different from the one they live in. By the end of the game, one of their dreams will be realized. It’s nice to spend time in a world where that’s not only certain, but believable.+++6
I am generally suspicious of games that people say are “better with friends,” simply because most things are. Manual labor, paying taxes, repeatedly hitting your thumb with a hammer—these are all things that are “better with friends.” Humans are social creatures, and company can make both miserable and pleasant things a whole lot better. “Better with friends” is rarely a good selling point. Wolfenstein: Youngblood isn’t really just better with friends; it requires them. Sure, you can play it solo, the game notes, ceding control of your ever-present companion to the game’s questionable artificial intelligence, but to do so is often frustrating. I’ll just underline it here, in bold permanent marker: I highly recommended that you don’t bother with Wolfenstein: Youngblood if you intend to play it solely by yourself. Play some of it solo, sure. I did! But all of it? Definitely not. That’s not a ding against Youngblood. The game has always been positioned as a cooperative experience meant for two players—the $40 deluxe release even comes with a buddy code for someone else to download the game for free, the only restriction being that they can play solely with whoever gave them the code. It’s a co-op shooter. To criticize it for not being something other than that is unreasonable. Illustration for article titled iWolfenstein: Youngblood/i: The iKotaku/i Review In Wolfenstein: Youngblood, you play as Zofia and Jessica Blazkowicz, the twin daughters of previous series protagonist B.J. Blazkowicz and his wife, Anya Oliwa. Set in a world where the Nazis won World War II and achieved world domination, the game begins in 1980, roughly 19 years after The New Colossus, which ends in a new American revolution against the Nazi occupation. By the start of Youngblood, that revolution has succeeded, and Jess and Soph have grown up together on the Blazkowicz family farm in Mesquite, Texas. As the daughters of resistance fighters who liberated America from Nazi occupiers, they’ve been raised to be survivors. Even though they grew up in the relative safety of liberated America, the Nazis have continued their despotic reign abroad. Hating Nazis runs deep in Zofia and Jessica, and killing Nazis is in their blood. So when their father goes missing in occupied Paris, the brash 18-year-old twins seize the moment, stealing a helicopter and some power armor in order to find their father and join the family’s Nazi-killing business. ADVERTISEMENT And they are so freaking hyped to kill Nazis. Youngblood is built from the ground-up for teamwork. Enemies are tougher to sneak up on or fight head-on, so you need to decide on an approach and communicate the best way to execute. Bosses and firefights are infuriatingly difficult without a real person to coordinate with—it’s maddeningly unclear what you can expect when getting into a firefight, as enemy reinforcements stream in with no parseable logic, making for grueling shootouts when playing solo that are much easier to handle with someone watching your back. But even with a partner, things get harder than they have to be if you don’t comb over the game’s small-but-intricate maps, full of secrets and hints that might give you an edge in achieving your goals. Without taking the time to do that, you can have a tough time early on as you face super-soldiers high above your own level too early in the game to have a decent arsenal of skills or weapons. MachineGames’ Wolfenstein series is known for being fun-as-hell throwbacks to a tougher, denser era of first-person shooting. While you technically have the option of being stealthy or going in guns blazing, all roads eventually lead to the latter. How could they not? These guns are big and loud and full of purchasable upgrades. Few things are more Wolfenstein than a long corridor obscured by the fireworks of flashing muzzles and the red of Nazis reduced to raw meat. Few games depict the weighty, cathartic mess of digital shooting like Wolfenstein games do, and Youngblood easily earns the Wolfenstein name in this regard. Youngblood’s biggest departure is structural, which could be due to Dishonored developer Arkane Studios’ contributions. After an opening mission set on a zeppelin, Youngblood deposits you in Nue-Paris, a web of three small, open-ended maps with lots of interiors to explore, linked by a fast-travel system. Each district has a tower that holds a vital part of the Nazis’ Paris operation, and it’s up to you to figure out how to break into each. VIDEO GAMES MULTIPLATFORM Wolfenstein: Youngblood BACK OF THE BOX QUOTE "Excusez-moi, comment dit-on 'fuck Nazis'?"TYPE OF GAME Cooperative Nazi murder party, très bien! LIKED Dense Parisian maps full of secrets, rock-solid shooting, Nazis I killed. DISLIKED Difficult enemies, hidden tutorials, Nazis that killed me.

ADVERTISEMENT That is the immediate goal of Youngblood, one that you won’t be able to accomplish until you’ve spent some time taking on side missions of your choosing. Some might give you leads for finding a route into one of the towers; some might just help you level up and upgrade your skills to take on the tough foes lurking in each tower. You could choose to not do these side missions and storm the towers immediately, but I wouldn’t recommend it. Most of the important technical aspects of playing Wolfenstein: Youngblood aren’t unexplained, just easy to miss. Part of this is the easily ignorable method for teaching players how the game works. The tutorials are delivered by collectible laptops that are mostly in plain sight but not always placed in areas you have to be in. That means it’s possible that you never learn how to use the special ability you start with (easy enough to figure out on your own) or that enemies have different armor types best handled with different guns (it will ruin your day if you never learn this). That said, as a co-op game first and foremost, it is not built with solo convenience in mind. You cannot pause your game, even if you’re playing offline. Safe spaces abound for you to hide out, and there’s a hub area purely for chilling, but you play Youngblood at its pace, not yours. The meatiest and best bits of story are delivered via collectibles—an odd choice since stopping to read newspaper clippings isn’t really something you can do often in a co-op game. But it makes sense once you see that Youngblood intends for you to return to all three of its districts often, completing side missions throughout the campaign or keeping Paris Nazi-free in the postgame with different partners. This is truly fun to do—tearing through Nazis in this game is a goddamn joy—but without the rich storytelling the series is known for, it’s a little bit hollow. A consistent theme of MachineGames’ Wolfenstein saga is facism as a fickle, self-immolating ideology, incapable of sustained control. In creating an alternate history where Nazi Germany has conquered the world, the series argues that fascism yields no ideal dream to achieve—just a growing list of public enemies and increasingly deranged despots enabled by the complacent. As a game about the next generation, Wolfenstein: Youngblood becomes a story about the future, and while its spare story is largely unconcerned with digging into any perspective beyond “fuck Nazis,” the primary division between the facists and everyone else is tomorrow. Youngblood, however briefly, contemplates the responsibility we have toward raising the next generation with the skills necessary to defend freedom—to fight for a future, any future, better than this one. Illustration for article titled iWolfenstein: Youngblood/i: The iKotaku/i Review ADVERTISEMENT It’s too brief a story to truly do any of these ideas justice, and that brevity makes provocative narrative turns less appealing—a resistance leader from the previous game is now the head of the FBI, but without further context, that rings false to The New Colossus’ revolutionary spirit. Wolfenstein is one of the few video games where Nazi ideology is not something that sprang from some dark foreign ether, but rather a movement that took advantage of existing fear and bigotry. But since we’re immediately sent into the middle of another Nazi conflict with the more pinpointed goal of saving a family member, we don’t, unfortunately, get a look at what the revolution built over the previous 20 in-game years. Youngblood leaves Wolfenstein’s dream mostly in suspended animation, accomplished, in part, but also unseen. It is, it seems, a job for another game, not this one. It’s tempting to want Wolfenstein: Youngblood to be the rousing third chapter in a terrific revival of a classic franchise, but it’s not. Instead, it’s a fun, off-kilter experiment, a good game about doing good with your friend. Because killing Nazis is good, but it’s much better with friends.+++6
Following the recent release of the GeForce RTX 2060 Super and 2070 Super, we have the final piece in Nvidia’s Super puzzle. Coming in at the same $700 price point as its predecessor, the new RTX 2080 Super version will offer some performance increases, though we suspect we won’t see anything too dramatic considering the proposed specs and the fact that Nvidia doesn’t need to cannibalize sales of the 2080 Ti, nor does it have any direct competition at this price point. The GeForce RTX 2080 Super adds two extra SM units for a 4% increase in cores, meaning this is now a fully enabled TU104 silicon. This is the same silicon used by the standard RTX 2080, as well as the 2070. There’s also a 9% frequency uplift for the base clock, and a 6% increase for the boost clock. Due to the way GPU boost works though, we anticipate this will be closer to a 3 to 4% increase in frequency. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost The GDDR6 memory also sees a boost and now we’re looking at a peak data transfer speed of 15.5 Gbps, up from 14 Gbps, an 11% improvement in memory performance. These upgrades have increased the TDP by 16% from 215 watts up to 250 watts. Nvidia says the RTX 2080 Super delivers a robust 4K experience along with real-time ray tracing. For this review we’re going to look at the 4K gaming experience, while skipping over ray tracing for now as our opinion of the technology in its current state hasn’t changed since we covered it many months ago. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost We do plan to revisit ray tracing on a roundup piece with the Super graphics cards soon though, so if you’re interested in the technology that will no doubt be worth a read. For testing we’ve used our usual gaming rig comprised of an Intel Core i9-9900K clocked at 5 GHz with 32GB of DDR4-3400 memory. The latest drivers available at the time of testing have been used. We have 13 games to look at before the usual performance breakdowns and cost per frame data. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost Benchmarks The newest game in our battery of benchmarks, F1 2019, sees the 2080 Super deliver 75 fps on average making it — drum roll please — 4% faster than the standard 2080 and 17% slower than the 2080 Ti. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost Thankfully the margin is a little more noteworthy in Battlefield V. Here the 2080 Super offered an 8% performance uplift over the older 2080 and that basically put it on par with the newly discontinued Radeon VII. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost Rainbow Six Siege sees a minor 3% boost to the average frame rate over the standard 2080, though we do see a 6% improvement for the 1% low performance. This time the 2080 Super was 15% slower than the Ti model. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost Can we interest you in 1-2 fps more performance? Good, because that’s all you’re going to get in Metro Exodus. That’s to be expected given the specs. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost A 6% performance boost in Resident Evil 2 may be cause for celebration (for the same price if we’re totally fair), taking us to 66 fps on average at 4K, for some nice smooth gameplay. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost We didn’t quite hit 60 fps in Shadow of the Tomb Raider but given the 2080 Ti just falls short that’s not surprising. The extra memory bandwidth does allow the 2080 Super to beat the vanilla 2080 by an 11% margin in this title. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost Memory bandwidth isn’t that important in Fortnite, so a small 3% performance uplift over the standard 2080 for 72 fps on average at 4K. Still it was a nice smooth and very crisp looking gaming experience. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost When testing with The Division 2, the Super provided us with a 4% performance boost over the standard RTX 2080. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost DiRT Rally 2.0 gets a 3 fps performance boost. Ignore the 1% low result and we see a breathtaking 4% performance uplift. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost Forza Horizon 4, like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, is a game that benefits from some extra memory bandwidth at 4K and here we see a more significant 7% performance boost, taking the 2080 Super to 92 fps on average. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost We also see a 6% performance boost in Far Cry New Dawn which allowed the 2080 Super to just edge out the Radeon VII. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost The 2080 Super provided a 4% performance improvement from the standard 2080 in World War Z. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost Finally we have Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey for a 3 fps performance uplift, though that does equate to a 6% increase in frame rate. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost Power Consumption and Temperatures The RTX 2080 Super consumes 5% more power than the standard 2080, which sounds right given the specs and what we just saw performance-wise. This means it consumed 6% less power than the Radeon VII, but 24% more than the new 5700 XT. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost We also measured total system consumption from the wall and here we see the faster 2080 Super increased total draw by 12% over the standard 2080. There are a few reasons for this increase, the GDDR6 memory will be consuming more power given the 11% overclock, and the CPU will also be working slightly harder given the increase in performance. What’s interesting is that the 2080 Super does push system consumption higher than that of the Radeon VII. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost We won’t go into overclocking as with all Turing GPUs you’re likely looking at a ~10% performance boost at best through manual tinkering. The Founders Edition model we tested maxed out at 72 degrees in a 21 degree room and there it maintained a core clock speed of 1905 MHz with a fan speed of 1820 RPM, making this graphics card rather cool and quiet after an hour-long test in F1 2019. Performance Summary The RTX 2080 Super looks to be the least “super” graphics card from Nvidia yet, but before we get too bummed out with this release, let’s take a look at some performance breakdown graphs and cost per frame data. RTX 2080 Super vs. RTX 2080 @ 4K On average the 2080 Super was 5% faster than the standard 2080. For testing we used the MSI RTX 2080 Duke which comes with a modest overclock that sees it maintain 1905 MHz under load, the same operating frequency as the 2080 Super FE card. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost RTX 2080 Super vs. RTX 2080 @ 1440p For those of you gaming at 1440p on average you’re looking at a 6% performance uplift, similar to what we saw at 4K. Those of you who were planning to jump the gun anyway, will see some extra frames for the same price, so there’s that. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost RTX 2080 Super vs. RTX 2080 Ti @ 4K On average the RTX 2080 Super was 16% slower when compared to the 2080 Ti. This is not a massive difference and it is around 30% cheaper, so if you’re not after the most premium 4K experience possible, the 2080 Super looks to be a decent option. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost RTX 2080 Super vs. RTX 2080 Ti @ 1440p For gaming at 1440p the 2080 Ti looks to be a bit of a waste as the more affordable RTX 2080 Super was just 12% slower and never more than 19% slower worst case. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost RTX 2080 Super vs. Radeon RX 5700 XT @ 4K When compared to AMD’s new Radeon RX 5700 XT, the 2080 Super was on average 26% faster at 4K. Do consider that the 2080 is considerably more expensive (it costs 75% more), yet the GeForce was never more than 47% faster. Evidently the higher-end you go, the less value you get so you’ll have to decide if paying that kind of price premium for the ability to run at slightly higher quality settings is worth it. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost RTX 2080 Super vs. Radeon RX 5700 XT @ 1440p Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost When gaming at 1440p the RTX 2080 Super is less attractive as it was just 17% faster than the 5700 XT on average. Cost per Frame and Conclusion Starting with a MSRP comparison and using the 4K gaming data, we see that the RTX 2080 Super comes out at a cost of $9.85 per frame. Given it comes in at the same $700 MSRP as the original 2080, that makes it roughly 6% cheaper per frame. Compared to the 5700 XT you are paying 41% more per frame which is a massive price premium, but that’s just what you’re faced with when going up a level in performance. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost The 1440p results are less favorable, again looking strictly at MSRPs. We see that the 2080 Super costs $5.73 per frame, or 5% cheaper than the standard RTX 2080. It’s also 52% more costly than the 5700 XT per frame, so unless you need to go from around 106 fps on average to 122 fps, the Radeon GPU is a more sensible purchase. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost But what about current market pricing? The only major change in the analysis would be that the RTX 2080 Super will keep its price, while soon to be extinguished RTX 2080 cards have dropped down to $630 for some models. In that case the standard 2080 offers a better value given the small change in performance. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost Earlier this month we got the RTX 2070 Super and 2060 Super. The 2070 Super provides 12% more performance than the standard model and we liked the boost enough to kill off most competitors at this price point, though the Radeon RX 5700 XT comes very close in performance for less money. The 2060 Super, on the other hand, gave us nothing. It costs 18% more than the standard 2060 and was just 8% faster on average. We’re seeing a similar story with the RTX 2080 Super, where the performance lift is even less significant. Illustration for article titled Nvidia Geforce RTX 2080 Super Review: Just A Bit Of A Boost Overall, the RTX 2080 Super is a solid premium-priced GPU, it’s just not particularly exciting. Officially discounting the RTX 2080 to $600 would have been worlds more thrilling in our opinion. Put in other words, the RTX 2080 Super is ~9% faster on average than the GTX 1080 Ti at both 1440p and 4K. So we’re getting a performance boost, at the exact same price point, almost two and a half years later. Without a doubt, GTX 1080 Ti owners can rejoice at the news.+++6
